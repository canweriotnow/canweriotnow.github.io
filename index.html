            <p>There is a short list of terms that have entered the vernacular, in the tech
world and <em>a fortiori</em> in the startup world, which I detest. I can think of
no better term to express my emotion at these terms, for I consider them
beneath contempt and an assault on dignity. One, as I have mentioned, is
<em>“human capital”</em> - a term so offensive I can’t even.</p>

            <p>I was recently corresponding with a professor of mine about Wittgenstein, planning to set up a meeting to have a chat and catch up. Oh, and talk about Wittgenstein, as I found another place where philosophy is relevant to programming. In my last email to him, I happened to ask after one of his colleagues, who was my advisor, mentor, and one of the most influential people in my life.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>
            <p>Yesterday, Rep. Zoe Lofgren and Rep. Ron Wyden introduced a bill, known as “Aaron’s Law”, which amends the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)</a>, a 1986 bil which set most of the “cybercrime” statutes on the books today. This law, affectionately known as <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title18/html/USCODE-2010-title18-partI-chap47-sec1030.htm">U.S. Code Title 18, Part I, Chapter 47, §1030</a>, has been added to many times over the years (via the PATRIOT Act, and various bills related to issues of identity theft, etc.), but the substantial core of the bill has remained the same since 1986: vague, ominous, overly broad, and a rampant playground for prosecutorial misconduct.</p>

            <p>One of the most unfunny ironies of the rhetoric surrounding “job creators” in
contemporary American politics is that most of the jobs being created (or at
least, those with the greatest demand) are in the tech sector. Jobs like mine.
Jobs that automate processes that used to be performed by people.</p>

            <p>I decided to retire my old blog, which had devolved into a platform for rants rather than anything truly worthwhile… to me, anyhow. Sure, my rants were amusing at times, and people seemed to enjoy them, but that’s not the point of blogging for me.</p>
