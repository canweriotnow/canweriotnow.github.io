  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I wrote <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2014/10/23/welcome-to-the-dark-side-switching-to-emacs/">Welcome to The Dark Side: Switching to Emacs</a> in response to a tweet, but as any of my co-workers will attest, it doesn&rsquo;t take much to get me started on my Emacs workflow.</p>

<p>I feel like a religious convert&hellip; I miss those simple, unadorned Vim services but I&rsquo;m floored by the majesty of the stained glass and altar dressings and ritual of the Church of Emacs.</p>

<p>So before the jump, in the spirit of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you mine if you show me yours,&rdquo; my <a href="https://github.com/canweriotnow/.emacs.d">.emacs.d</a>.</p>

<h2>An Unexpected Journey</h2>

<p>I lived in my happy little Vim hobbit hole, smoking my pipe and enjoying my brandy. It was not a dirty hole, or a sandy hole, but a hobbit hole, which means comfort.</p>

<p>One day, a wizard visted me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/post-img/mccarthy1.jpg" title="'McCarthy at work at SAIL'" ></p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s when things began to get weird&hellip;</p>

<p>Okay, so maybe I didn&rsquo;t receive a visit from the revenant spirit of John McCarthy, ghost of programming past, present and future. Or maybe I did.</p>

<p>Maybe Paul Graham just convinced me I was <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">coding in Blub</a>, for whatever value of Blub I happened to be using.</p>

<p>See, the thing about Blub is it&rsquo;s a mutable value. When you&rsquo;re using C++ and Java comes along, you realize C++ was actually Blub. When you&rsquo;re using Perl for your day-to-day and discover Python, and then Ruby, you realize that not only was Python Blub, but Perl was an even Blubbier Blub.</p>

<p>Ruby&hellip; oh, Ruby. I still love Ruby. But then something happened.</p>

<p>I need to backpedal a bit.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s <em>using</em> a language, and then there&rsquo;s <em>building</em> something in it. I&rsquo;d played with Scheme (<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> is wonderful), and even Common Lisp, and I knew enough to appreciate the Lisp-nature of Ruby which, when combined with its Smalltalk-nature, I thought made for hte perfect productive language.</p>

<p>But see, I was <em>building</em> things in Ruby while I was <em>playing</em> with Lisp.</p>

<p>Along comes Clojure.</p>

<p>I was working in a pretty isolated programming role that granted me a lot of de facto autonomy. So when I got a request for a new service, I thought &ldquo;why not Clojure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re in late 2012 here, so bear with me.</p>

<p>My first Clojure project ran like a champ, was hailed as an unqualified success. Eventually I even <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2013/02/03/datetime-conversions-in-clojure/">blogged about</a> a piece of that project that handled datetimes.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to the present, I&rsquo;ve written Clojure in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, mostly <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> with the help of some awesome plugins from <a href="https://github.com/tpope">Tim Pope</a>.</p>

<p>Like I <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2014/10/23/welcome-to-the-dark-side-switching-to-emacs/">mentioned before</a>, I&rsquo;ve had a religious hatred for Emacs since the mid-1990s when I entered the *nix world and got involved in USENET.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/freebsdgirl">@freebsdgirl</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/darkuncle">@darkuncle</a> &#8230;and on that day, war broke out, destroying the fragile peace that had been brokered so long ago.</p>&mdash; jason λewis (@canweriotnow) <a href="https://twitter.com/canweriotnow/status/527532324234489857">October 29, 2014</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>The war is far from over&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;but, I digress.</p>

<p>I started the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Clojure/">Baltimore Clojure Meetup</a> and met more Emacs users than I had in one place in a long time. Again, I dismissed Emacs.</p>

<p>That is, until I found <a href="http://lighttable.com/">LightTable</a> completely b0rked again and threw up my hands.</p>

<p>Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t have eaten my hands to begin with&hellip; sorry, equivocation humor. Can&rsquo;t resist.</p>

<h2>Welcome to Emacs</h2>

<p>So yeah, I went over my starter packages in the <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2014/10/23/welcome-to-the-dark-side-switching-to-emacs/">earlier post</a>, but I didn&rsquo;t talk about the full experience of discovery I underwent when I fully committed to emacs.</p>

<p>Sure, there&rsquo;s the whole <code>cider-mode</code> and <code>cider-jack-in</code> and <code>cider-nrepl</code> and even <code>cider-scratch</code> that make LightTable&rsquo;s inline evaluation modes look like child&rsquo;s play (no offense to Chris Granger, LightTable is beautiful, I love it, but&hellip; y&#8217;know, Emacs).</p>

<p>So I did those things, started with <a href="http://batsov.com/prelude/">Prelude</a>, added all the Clojure fun I could find, and got to work.</p>

<p>I also subscribed to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs">/r/emacs</a>, and did a little reading on the <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/">Emacs Wiki</a>.</p>

<p>Have you ever been comfortably reading (or coding) under a tree, and you see a white rabbit in a waistcoat with a pocket-watch run by complaining he&rsquo;s late?</p>

<p>Thus such adventures begin.</p>

<h2>EAT ME / DRINK ME</h2>

<p>As I fell to the bottom (or so I thought) of the rabbit-hole, I found a bottle of <code>cider</code> labeled <em>Drink Me,</em> and so I drank the <code>cider</code>. Suddenly, I could eval Clojure inline, jump to docstrings, jump to source for a fn, and it was wonderful.</p>

<p>The last time I tried Emacs, I always joked about how I was using Emacs but always edited my .emacs config with Vim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not this time,&rdquo; I thought, and used <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Projectile">Projectile</a> to manage my <code>.emacs.d</code> and edited my <code>user.el</code> in Emacs. Oh, it was better! Then, thought I, I should put my <code>.emacs.d</code> in source control (actually, it was demanded:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/canweriotnow">@canweriotnow</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/willowdower">@willowdower</a> Now you must post your config on github so that we may critique it.</p>&mdash; Alex Redington (@holy_chao) <a href="https://twitter.com/holy_chao/status/511574770388041728">September 15, 2014</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>&hellip;yeah).</p>

<p>But then I realized I was doing the <code>⌘-Tab</code> to iTerm to run <code>git ci -a</code> (I pity the fool that doesn&rsquo;t alias common git commoands) in&hellip; wait for it&hellip; <code>$EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim</code>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when I found a bit of fairy cake called <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/Magit">magit</a>, and I ate a bit of that and my Git workflow was inside of Emacs. Now it was a simple <code>M-x magit-status</code> to view my working tree state, where I could hit <code>s</code> to stage files for commit, and <code>C-c C-c</code> to commit changes, and <code>P P</code> to push.</p>

<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>

<h2>Curiouser and Curiouser</h2>

<p>Well, if Emacs can handle my Git workflow, what <em>can&rsquo;t</em> it do, I wondered?</p>

<p>I went a bit mad playing with multiple buffer and frame layouts; on one occasion I opened a shell inside an emacs biffer and launched the command-line version of emacs in a shell inside the windowed version of emacs.</p>

<p>Recursive rabbit holes.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re running the Cocoa-nested version of Emacs (not Aquamacs, fuck that noise, but just GNU Emacs packaged as a .app), you get some suggestions from the menus. Gnus for USENET or email, various games, a calendar&hellip;</p>

<p>Calendar?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s whan I discovered Org-Mode.</p>

<h2>Org-Mode FTW</h2>

<p><a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> is an Emacs major mode that lets you organize your life. All of it. I&rsquo;m not even going into detail here, it&rsquo;s a deep, deep well. You can use it for a TODO list, sync it with your phone, use it <a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2014/03/05/octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode-v2/">to write</a> your <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress blog</a>.</p>

<p>(Confession: This blog is powered by octopress, and although it&rsquo;s now written in Emacs, I&rsquo;ve not gone full crazy and started composing it with Org-Mode)</p>

<h2>Twittering-Mode WTF</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s when I started going down the tunnel of &ldquo;well, what <em>else</em> can it do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I discovered <code>twittering-mode</code>.</p>

<p>A quick <code>M-x package-install RET twittering-mode</code> puts a Twitter client in your text editor. Like you always needed. <code>M-x twit</code> will jump you right into your Twitter feed, <code>i</code> will enable user icons (yes, user avatars right in goddamn Emacs), and <code>u</code> will jump you to a buffer where you can compose a Tweet and hit <code>C-c C-c</code> to send it.</p>

<h2>Playing Games</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention that <code>M-x package-install RET 2048-mode</code> will install a game of 2048 in Emacs. Because that&rsquo;s really fucking important, you know?</p>

<p><strong>Sigh</strong></p>

<p>For good reason, Emacs comes standard with an AI psychotherapist named Eliza.</p>

<p>A quick <code>M-x doctor</code> and you&rsquo;re in therapy.</p>

<p>Which you&rsquo;ll probably need.</p>

<h2>&hellip;and Much, Much More</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface, but I feel like this post is long enough. There&rsquo;s so much down here, down the Emacs rabbit hole, that it will probably take me weeks to even catch up to whre I am right now; what I&rsquo;ve described so far is my first few days with this <del>operating system</del> text editor.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s a fun ride.</p>

<h3>Postscript</h3>

<p>Sorry for the Tolkien digression when my dominant allusion was <em>Alice in Wonderland&hellip;</em> Emacs is a weird place.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the way home this afternoon I was asked to explain Clojure&rsquo;s <code>reify</code> macro, and apparently I did quite well, as an &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moment resulted. So I shall endeavour to explain <code>reify</code> here in the hope that such a moment might be available to others.</p>

<p>Reify derives from the Latin <em>res,</em> or &ldquo;thing.&rdquo; So <code>reify</code> fundamentally means &ldquo;make a <em>thing</em> out of&hellip;.</p>

<h3>Protocols and Datatypes</h3>

<p>Clojure <a href="http://grimoire.arrdem.com/1.6.0/clojure.core/defprotocol/">protocols</a> are similar to Java interfaces: They define a set of methods/functions purely by their signatures without providing implementation details. Declaring that a class implements an interface (in Java) or that a record implements a protocol (in Clojure) is a contract that specifies that the given class or record, in order to be valid, will provide concrete implementations of those methods/functions.</p>

<p>But sometimes we don&rsquo;t need a reusable entity with reusable implementations that we can instantiate willy-nilly; sometimes we just need a <em>thing</em> that implements those methods.</p>

<p>In Java, anonymous inner classes can fulfill this purpose. In Clojure, we have <code>reify.</code></p>

<h3>That Nameless Thing</h3>

<p>OK, it&rsquo;s not really going to be nameless&hellip; let&rsquo;s say we have a putative protocol as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defprotocol </span><span class="nv">Foo</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">bar</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">this</span><span class="p">])</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">baz</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">this</span> <span class="nv">st</span><span class="p">])</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">quux</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">this</span> <span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">]))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So if we were creating a new record, we might do:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defrecord </span><span class="nv">FooRecord</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nv">Foo</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">bar</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">this</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">println </span><span class="nv">this</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">baz</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">this</span> <span class="nv">st</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str </span><span class="nv">this</span> <span class="nv">st</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">quux</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">this</span> <span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str </span><span class="nv">this</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">* </span><span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">))))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Which is perfect if we need to repeatedly instantiate a FooRecord that implements the Foo protocol. But sometimes we just need a Foo and be done with it. And so, Clojure gives us <code>reify</code>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have to start this post by saying I&rsquo;ve been a dogmatic <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> partisan since the 1990&rsquo;s, when I started using vi on the Solaris and Irix boxen I had access to, and then on my own machines when I got started with Linux in 1994.</p>

<p>I flamed against Emacs on Usenet, called it all the epithets (Escape Meta Alt Ctrl Delete, Eight Megs And Constantly Swapping (8 megs was a lot then), Eventually Mangles All Computer Storage)&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t stand the chord keys and lack of modality.</p>

<p>Even once I got heavily into Lisp I still tried to stick with Vim, or tried LightTable, or Atom, or SublimeText. But then one day I hit a wall and Emacs (plus cider-mode and slime and a few other packages) was the obvious solution. Now I&rsquo;m out there evangelizing Emacs (I&rsquo;m writing this post in the Markdown major mode plus some helpful minor modes) and I figure I&rsquo;d offer some advice for those looking to convert to the Church of Emacs.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s my first time in Las Vegas. We went to In-N-Out Burger (required if I

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s August 19th, the day we remember why the lucky stiff&rsquo;s poignant departure
from the internet. <a href="https://github.com/ruby-jokes">ruby-jokes</a> would hate to
part with the <a href="http://whyday.org/">Whyday</a> tradition of hacking on something just for fun and releasing
it into the wild.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s with great ambivalence we announce <a href="https://github.com/ruby-jokes/whynot">whynot</a>,
a gem that does irresponsible things because&hellip; why not?</p>

<p>whynot is for when you really just don&rsquo;t care. It started as a single monkey-patch
to <code>Kernel</code>, called <code>maybe</code>. <code>maybe</code> takes a block, and may or may not yield the
result. So for instance:</p>

<p>About half the time, this will return <code>6</code>. The other half, <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>About three minutes after I pushed whynot to Github, <a href="https://twitter.com/mi_c_ah">Micah Gates</a>
added some kernel methods that allowed for a little more specificity: <code>mostly</code>,
which will execute your code about 2/3 of the time, and <code>occasionally</code>, which
has about a 1 in 5 chance of actually executing your code.</p>

<h4>But wait, there&rsquo;s more!</h4>

<p>Just in time for the 0.0.4 release this afternoon, I decided sometimes, the truth
doesn&rsquo;t matter. Or, at least, you just don&rsquo;t care. So I added <code>meh</code>. Sometimes
true, sometimes false, whatever. When you really don&rsquo;t care, just do this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">meh</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="s2">&quot;I guess&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Nah.&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I really wanted to create a global value like <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> that was neither
truthy nor falsey, but I&rsquo;m not sure whether that&rsquo;s possible, and I have a feeling
it would require some C-extension hackery if it is.</p>

<p>Perhaps for a future release?</p>

<p>As always, pull requests are welcome, and use at your own risk.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve always taken a hands-off approach to moderating comments, feeling that it was a form of censorship to restrict discussion even on my own blog. It&rsquo;s worked pretty well; I feel like prior to yesterday, I&rsquo;ve deleted less than three comments in the three years I&rsquo;ve maintained this blog.</p>

<p>But yesterday&rsquo;s post, <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2014/06/09/im-telling/">I&rsquo;m Telling :: Employer-Tattling and The Decline of Agency</a>, brought in some of the nastiest of trolls, and I had to re-evaluate that policy. The post also got so many comments I was going crazy trying to weigh my anti-censorship views against comments that bordered on hate speech.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other night Twitter was abuzz with controversy and drama, as per usual. One of those threads (which I&rsquo;ll get to momentarily) invovled what I&rsquo;ll refer to as &ldquo;employer-tattling,&rdquo; and <a href="https://twitter.com/soederpop">Jon Soeder</a> (laudably without drawing attention to the ongoing echo chamber), tweeted this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet center" lang="en"><p>If somebody says something vile on the internet, it is not your place to notify their employer. You are setting a terrible precedent.</p>&mdash; your boy jon soeder (@soederpop) <a href="https://twitter.com/soederpop/statuses/475127514655100929">June 7, 2014</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>He doesn&rsquo;t mention which Twitter thread prompted this, but I have an educated guess.</p>

<p>I fucking hate this school. All the teachers too. Well, there are a few exceptions, but few enough it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>

<p>There are a few saving graces. Molly, that redhead in fourth period I&rsquo;m dying to fuck. There&rsquo;s a party Friday, maybe that&rsquo;ll happen. At least I&rsquo;ll be drunk enough not to care about this shithole for a few hours.</p>

<p>Had a test today. Fucking Mr. Blum walked over to my desk and watched me solve quadratic equations. Grabbed the calculator out of my hand when he saw me using the program I wrote to solve them. Old fucking moron doesn&rsquo;t even know what these piece of shit TI-83&rsquo;s are capable of. Thought I was cheating.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I&rsquo;m planning a full &ldquo;overview&rdquo; reflection on <a href="http://educonphilly.org">EduCon 2.6</a>, I was (pardon the pun) privileged to participate in a conversation entitled <a href="http://educonphilly.org/conversations/The_Privileged_Voices_in_Education">&ldquo;The Privileged Voices in Education&rdquo;</a>, facilitated by <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">Audrey Watters</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TheJLV">Jose Vilson</a>. Audrey has written about the session on <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2014/01/26/the-privileged-voices-in-education-educon/?utm_content=buffer01abf&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">her blog</a>, and Jose has written about it on <a href="http://thejosevilson.com/educon-addressing-privilege-developing-learners-race/">his blog</a>, so you can refer to those for context. But I want to talk about my takeaways from that wonderful session and what came after while it&rsquo;s fresh in my mind, and then work on a more general EduCon post.</p>

<h3>Privilege</h3>

<p>This is a Hard Topic to address in a meaningful way that actually effects change. It&rsquo;s a hard topic to broach in general. I applaud Audrey and Jose for creating this EduCon session, for their facilitation of the conversation, and I&rsquo;m in awe of how civil, insightful, and enlightening the discourse was.</p>

<p>Let me start by confessing: as often happens, I was unable to make it through the discussion without saying something (at the very least) bothersome. I talked about my initial reaction to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23edchat&amp;src=typd">#edchat</a>, a hashtag-based recurring event for educators on Twitter, as an offhand preface to the difficulty of certain discussions in diverse media. <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwhitby">Tom Whitby</a>, founder of #edchat, was in the room. This actually opened a (in my opinion) constructive dialogue <em>ex post facto,</em> but I&rsquo;ll return to this later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ruby-jokes">Ruby Jokes</a> team has a new gem for you that was designed, tested, and released in about an hour this afternoon: <a href="http://ruby-jokes.github.io/taint_aliases">taint_aliases</a>. You can get the full details <a href="https://github.com/ruby-jokes/taint_aliases">on GitHub</a>, but I thought a friendly introduction might make for an enlightening blog post.</p>

<h3>Grundle Your Objects</h3>

<p>You see, not everyone prefers the word &ldquo;taint&rdquo;. Some people are very clinical, and say &lsquo;perineum&rsquo;. Others prefer &lsquo;grundle&rsquo; or &lsquo;fleshy fun bridge&rsquo;. We wanted to give you options, so <code>taint_aliases</code> makes a variety of synonyms available to you.</p>
