  <div class="entry-content"><p>So in the comments on my <a href="/blog/2013/03/11/confessions-of-a-job-destroyer/">last post</a> I confessed my fandom for what is, in my opinion, the most brilliant and important blog currently published, that of <a href="http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/">Michael O. Church</a>. His recent series of posts have been reviewing and analyzing the MacLeod theory of <a href="http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/gervais-macleod-9-convexity/">organizational structure</a> (link is to the latest post in the series, but if you haven&#8217;t been following it, there are links to the previous eight).</p>

<p>I want to focus on the differential between concave (in which the difference between failure and middling is greatest) and convex (in which the difference between middling and superior is greatest) work.</p>

<h3>The &#8220;IT Department&#8221;</h3>

<p>I have to start by saying &#8220;Information Technology&#8221; is a leaky abstraction. It covers everything from internal software development to the help desk call center. Now, I don&#8217;t want to start by suggesting that either line of business is superior. Both are absolutely necessary, at least until developers start to become psychic or users stop being stupid, or (preferably) both.</p>

<p>The real problem comes when the same management structure is imposed in the guise of an &#8220;IT Department&#8221; on such divergent areas as the help desk, desktop support, network engineers, developers, and hardware techs. Going beyond theories <a href="http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/gervais-macleod-8-human-nature-theories-x-y-z-and-a/">X, Y, Z, or A</a> of management, having a &#8220;Cenral IT&#8221; organization is (without a revolutionary management strategy that will probably raise HR issues for most entrenched organizations) an attempt to shoehorn concave and convex work into the same tiny box, and is going to fail at appropriately managing one or the other (or perhaps more likely, both).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most unfunny ironies of the rhetoric surrounding &#8220;job creators&#8221; in contemporary American politics is that most of the jobs being created (or at least, those with the greatest demand) are in the tech sector. Jobs like mine. Jobs that automate processes that used to be performed by people.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ll come out and say it: I&#8217;m not a job creator (which is, I suppose, why the Republicans aren&#8217;t too interested in cutting <em>my</em> taxes). I&#8217;m a job destroyer.</p>

<p>We (programmers) all are, on some level or another; we&#8217;re taking mundane repetitive tasks and automating them with code. In a perfect world, we would be hailed as heroes, freeing the toiling masses from their humdrum routines to engage in more ennobling pursuits&#8230; but there&#8217;s that pesky issue of needing an income. I&#8217;ll return to this momentarily, but I first want to confess to a darker truth.</p>

<p>Marc Andreessen famously explained <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html">&#8216;Why Software Is Eating The World&#8217;</a> in the WSJ a couple of years ago. What he failed to mention is that the snake of software is also quietly eating its own tail.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a post I&#8217;ve wanted to write for a while, but I&#8217;ve needed time and distance to do it justice. This is a post about (from my perspective) the greatest failure of my professional career.</p>

<h2>The Social University</h2>

<p>Sometime in 2011, I was joking with my team lead about connecting <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/platforms/transact/overview.aspx">Blackboard Transact</a>, the OLTP product used for access control, stored value account transactions, and meal plans at my work, to Twitter, just for fun. The short answer was &#8220;that&#8217;s silly.&#8221; The longer answer was &#8220;that&#8217;s silly, but it would be pretty neat.&#8221;</p>

<p>So on lunch breaks and when I was waiting on other things to move forward with my &#8220;official&#8221; projects, I played around with creating a system to connect our system to Twitter.</p>

<p>Since I had already worked on a service layer for (really, a generalized SOA for systems connecting to) Transact, it was pretty easy to leverage APIs from not only Twitter, but also Foursquare and Facebook to tie into transactions from our internal system; door access could tweet your location, and check you in on Foursquare; buying a coffee could do the same.</p>

<p>Eventually, the idea gained some traction, and we started building in a system of social gamification, that would award badges and achievements for usage of the system, ranging from customer loyalty rewards for particpating vendors, to seemingly &#8220;silly&#8221; things like a &#8220;Speed Demon&#8221; achivement for swiping two doors on opposite sides of campus within ten minutes.</p>

<p>The system also allowed students (well, also faculty and staff) to connect to Facebook to share badges/achivements and compete in a university-wide leaderboard. This is just an overview of the social media integration and gamification elements, but you might very well ask, what&#8217;s the point?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Linux <a href="http://www.linux-pam.org/">PAM</a> (Pluggable Authentication Modules) architecture is one of the most wonderful (and most overlooked) features of the OS. Typically we only consider PAM as handling our console (or xdm/gdm etc. logins) on Linux, but it&#8217;s useful for so much more.</p>

<h3>Web Authentication</h3>

<p>At work, we needed an authentication solution that allowed users to sign in with their ActiveDirectory credentials. Although the &#8220;official&#8221; solution was to use <a href="http://www.ca.com/us/secure-single-sign-on.aspx">SiteMinder</a> for web authentication against AD, we were working on a mobile application, and at the time the SiteMinder auth page was ugly, and had no mobile-optimized login page. The latter problem has since been rectified; now it has both an ugly desktop login and an ugly mobile login. In addition, we were using nginx, and SiteMinder was really only supported under IIS and Apache (and at the time, the latter was via Shibboleth. Ugh.), so without official SiteMinder support, or an nginx Shib plug-in, we were in a bit of a bind.</p>

<p>Around the same time, I was playing with Likewise Open (now known as <a href="http://www.powerbrokeropen.org/">PowerBroker Identity Services - Open Edition</a>) to bind my Linux workstation into AD. So it occurred to me: if a normal Linux PAM login can be authenticated against ActiveDirectory, why not a PAM login from a web application?</p>

<p>I know, I know, my first though should have been LDAP, right? For some unknown reason, LDAP was verboten at the time. The policy has since (apparently) been reversed, but such is the ebb and flow of corporate politics. And so, in the grand tradition of one of the mothers of modern computer science (and one of my daughter&#8217;s namesakes):</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From the crack team (<a href="https://twitter.com/micahjgates">Micah Gates</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/canweriotnow">myself</a>) that brought you <a href="https://github.com/ruby-jokes/job_interview">job_interview</a>, I&#8217;m proud to announce the availability of <a href="https://github.com/ruby-jokes/close_enough">close_enough</a>, a gem that will save you from all of those niggling <code>NoMethodError</code>s that occur when you mis-type a method name.</p>

<p>The concept is very simple, and based on an algorithm used in most spell checkers and autocorrect systems currently in use. Calculating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance">Damerau-Levenshtein distance</a> between two words can reliably (within a certain margin of error) indicate whether a known word was inteded when an unknown term was encountered in user input.</p>

<p>In Ruby, we have a wonderful metaprogramming facility in <code>method_missing</code>. What we&#8217;ve done in close_enough is to monkey-patch <code>method_missing</code> on <code>Object</code> to calculate the Demerau-Levenshtein distance between existing methods and the non-existent called method, and invoke the nearest one if it&#8217;s &#8220;close enough&#8221; (close enough currently being an edit distance of &lt; 3).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In dealing with integrating data from disparate incomaptible systems (which I do to a degree that would drive some men mad), one of the most frequent irritations is dealing with datetime conversions.</p>

<p>A while ago, I <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2012/08/03/legacy-systems-on-rails-part-2/">wrote a post about Bubba</a> (not its real name), a legacy/vendor-supplied system in which the original developers (may they suffer eternal torment) decided to store all datetimes as floating-point values using a bastardized form of the Julian Day system with fractional day part. In that post, I showed a solution used in a Ruby on Rails web app, but now I&#8217;m writing data integration services for multiple systems, and needed something a bit more robust, so I&#8217;m writing it in Clojure.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll start off with the dependencies:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I&#8217;m using the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/clj-time">clj-time</a> library by Sean Corfield. It&#8217;s basically a wrapper around the <a href="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/">Joda Time</a> Java library, allowing us to use its powerful datetime handling in idiomatic Clojure.</p>

<p>So, for the actual code. First, the Bubba dates need to be converted to and from a floating point value to a normal Date object.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I don&#8217;t blog much about my gaming habit, but I recently got my invite to <a href="http://www.ingress.com">Ingress</a>, Google&#8217;s new location-based MMORPG. Much has been written about the extensive (one might even say brilliant) <a href="http://www.nianticproject.com">viral marketing campaign</a> that launched the game, and there has been some interesting speculation as to Google&#8217;s motivation in producing such a game, ranging from the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/138res/google_launches_ingress_a_worldwide_mobile/c71v7yv?context=2">begrudgingly admiring</a> to the <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/11/19/googles-ingress-is-more-than-a-game-its-a-potential-data-exploitation-disaster/">borderline paranoid</a>.</p>

<p>True, a persistently location-aware app that collects GPS and accelerometer data the entire time it&#8217;s active has obvious implications for a data-ravenous company like Google. And I&#8217;ve seen a few reasonable theories so far as to the &#8220;real&#8221; motivation behind the game (and Google&#8217;s &#8220;real&#8221; motivation - always and everywhere - is surely data). A breakdown of what I&#8217;ve seen so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ingress is about tracking player &#8220;areas of operation&#8221; - the assumption being that you&#8217;ll be playing most in the areas you habituate anyway - harvesting data for better location-targeted ads. Google is essentially an advertising company, so this makes sense.</li>
<li>Ingress is about improving Google Maps with pedestrian and footpath data - the Maps product is pretty great for driving, but as for routing pedestrian traffic, well&#8230; I&#8217;ve had it suggest a longer route because the shorter would involve <em>walking</em> the &#8220;wrong way&#8221; down a one-way street. Walking directions are improving, but they rarely suggest cutting through a park, for instance, even when it would save 20 min. traveling time. And that kind of data is hard to get in an automated fashion, and often involves undocumented local knowledge. Using Ingress not only gets players to collect footpath data, but leverages local knowledge of pedestrian routes.</li>
</ol>


<p>I think both of these theories are probably accurate, but they don&#8217;t go far enough.</p>

<p>It was actually during an extended period of playing Ingress last week that it occurred to me&#8230; I was plotting a run around the college campus where I work and thought to myself, wouldn&#8217;t it be a neat feature if the game could help me plot the most efficient route between all these portals.</p>

<h5>Yeah. See it yet?</h5>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been following with great interest the recent debate over DCI vs. Concerns vs. Whatever in Ruby. The best take I&#8217;ve seen, however, is Tony Arcieri&#8217;s recent post, <a href="http://tonyarcieri.com/dci-in-ruby-is-completely-broken">&#8220;DCI&#8221; in Ruby Is Compeltely Broken</a>.</p>

<p>Reading his post, it ocurred to me that what Rubyists are trying to do with <code>object.extend(Module)</code> is precisely what Lisp hackers have been doing for years with macros, but it&#8217;s an ugly hack when applied in the wrong paradigm (or, at least, the wrong language).</p>

<p>Now, I was initially a big fan <em>conceptually</em> of DCI. It seemed intuitive, even familiar. And it helped that it was the brainchild of Trygve Reenskaug, the erstwhile inventor of MVC, possibly one of the most useful OOP patterns ever devised.</p>

<p>But the more familiar it seemed, the more difficult it seemed to implement properly, much less efficiently, even in the purest of modern OO languages, i.e., Ruby.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I tried to forget everything I knew about OOP that its familiarity became clear: this novel appropach to object-oriented design is embedded in the most natural thing in the world in the oldest of functional programming languages, Lisp.</p>

<p>Enter the macro. In Clojure, providing context to a function is straightforward using a macro, for instance, a database query (n.b., most of this is straight example code from <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org">wikibooks.org</a>).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using the simplest of (admittedly cribbed) examples here for the sake of demonstration, but right away here, we&#8217;ve got the D and C of DCI - Data and Context. As for interaction&#8230; we could easily conceive of a <code>with-role</code> macro which determines the interaction of the database connection and the actual application of the <code>with-connection</code> macro, whether it invokes a SELECT, CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.</p>

<p>In a Lisp, this level of composition is completely <em>natural,</em> is my point. In a language like Ruby (which despite having much of the Lisp nature, is OO to its core), and especially in a framework like Rails, with its cargo-cult Design Pattern-worshipping user base (I&#8217;m going to take some shit for that one, but accept that I&#8217;m exaggerating and flame with that in mind), is it any surprise that a pattern that makes <em>total sense</em> in an FP context is going to be a hot controversy in an OOP context?</p>

<p>I agree with Tony&#8217;s post that &#8220;DCI&#8221; in Rails is totally broken. But that&#8217;s because, IMHO, DCI isn&#8217;t the best pattern for OOP. Yeah, Ruby has <em>lots</em> of functional features, but maybe we need to rethink how we&#8217;re doing this DCI stuff (or Concerns, or whatever), on the basis that messing with inheritance and the class hierarchy is the <em>wrong thing,</em> and perhaps we should be creatively exploring the use of blocks and lambdas and Ruby&#8217;s other functional constructs.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not offering any solutions here, but I&#8217;m hoping I can contribute to the conversation. Step away from the mixins, away from the class hierarchy, away from the object model. Maybe take another read of Design Patterns and see if DCI is another hot YAGNI thing. I don&#8217;t know yet. I just know it reminds me of how things are AWESOME in a whole other paradigm that doesn&#8217;t necessarily apply to your Rails app.</p>

<p>As a caveat, I should say that I haven&#8217;t really tried to use this DCI mojo in a production application, although I have played with different ideas about it Just For Fun&copy;. If you think I&#8217;m wrong, or have the whole thing arse-about-face, I&#8217;d be happy to discuss it in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a while since my last post in this series (if you missed them, here are parts <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2012/08/02/legacy-systems-on-rails-part-1/">one</a> and <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2012/08/03/legacy-systems-on-rails-part-2/">two</a>) but I wanted to return to the topic of building out Rails applications on top of legacy systems.</p>

<h3>Abstraction is your friend</h3>

<p>I think if there&#8217;s a common theme in these posts, it&#8217;s abstraction. Primarily, using Ruby and Rails to abstract away the crazy implementation details of a system that&#8217;s been accumulating cruft for over twenty years. I&#8217;m going to start referring to this system as &#8220;Bubba&#8221; for the sake of convenience (and since I don&#8217;t have permission from the vendor to say what it actually is).</p>

<p>I mentioned in Part One that most of the access to the backend system going forward is occurring via a REST API wrapping the Oracle database that serve&#8217;s as Bubba&#8217;s back-end. Today I wanted to look at how the user-facing portions are constructed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sadly, I haven&#8217;t added a blog post in roughly 2.5 months. I&#8217;ve had ideas for posts, but when it came time to set pen to page (or fingers to keyboard, as teh case may be) I just haven&#8217;t had it in me. I really enjoy writing this blog, too. I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what was going on, until I read one of the most insightful blog posts I&#8217;ve ever seen: <a href="http://edu.mkrecny.com/thoughts/be-nice-to-programmers">Be Nice To Programmers</a>.</p>

<p>The tl;dr is a dialogue between a programmer and a guy who wishes he had the chops because he thinks coding is the neatest job in the world. The programmer tells him he thinks coding is making him miserable because the the development/debug process is the ultimate negative feedback loop.</p>

<blockquote><p>My workflow is something like this.</p><p>write some code<br/>run the code<br/>get an error message<br/>find the error and back to step 1<br/>Hour by hour, day after day, I do this. Always searching for what&#8217;s wrong with what I&#8217;m creating, rarely thinking about what&#8217;s good about it. It&#8217;s a negative reinforcement feedback loop.</p><footer><strong>[http://edu.mkrecny.com/thoughts/be-nice-to-programmers]</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='The main reason to become a programmer is that the position of &#8216;God&#8217; is unavailable. Your _job_ is to create universes where the fundamental laws of nature, so to speak, are completely under your creative control.'>
I definitely get the sentiment. But I think of this as the inner loop in the red-green-refactor cycle, so to speak. Yeah, coding (<em>especially</em> doing proper TDD) is going to make you hate the world (and possibly feel like an idiot) sometimes. But overall&#8230; I was in a job interview a few weeks ago, and was asked why I love being a programmer. I didn&#8217;t even have to think about my response: The main reason to become a programmer is that the position of &#8216;God&#8217; is unavailable. Your <em>job</em> is to create universes where the fundamental laws of nature, so to speak, are completely under your creative control. Ultimately, that&#8217;s the takeaway: programming is <em>awesome.</em> But a job is still a job, and I think that&#8217;s where some of the negative feedback loop comes in.
</span></p>

<p>My last post was just before a huge project I&#8217;d both originated and put a large amount of my time and effort into over the course of 15-18 months was shelved. It was ready to ship, but corporate politics being what it is (i.e., something I&#8217;d schedule a root canal to avoid, <em>especially</em> where I work), I tried to just move on and not lose sleep over it. Still, it rankled.</p>
