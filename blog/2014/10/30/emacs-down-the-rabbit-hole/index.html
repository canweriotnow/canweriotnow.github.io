    <p>So I wrote <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2014/10/23/welcome-to-the-dark-side-switching-to-emacs/">Welcome to The Dark Side: Switching to Emacs</a> in response to a tweet, but as any of my co-workers will attest, it doesn’t take much to get me started on my Emacs workflow.</p>

<p>I feel like a religious convert… I miss those simple, unadorned Vim services but I’m floored by the majesty of the stained glass and altar dressings and ritual of the Church of Emacs.</p>

<p>So before the jump, in the spirit of “I’ll show you mine if you show me yours,” my <a href="https://github.com/canweriotnow/.emacs.d">.emacs.d</a>.</p>

<h2 id="an-unexpected-journey">An Unexpected Journey</h2>

<p>I lived in my happy little Vim hobbit hole, smoking my pipe and enjoying my brandy. It was not a dirty hole, or a sandy hole, but a hobbit hole, which means comfort.</p>

<p>One day, a wizard visted me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/post-img/mccarthy1.jpg" alt="'McCarthy at work at SAIL'" /></p>

<p>And that’s when things began to get weird…</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Okay, so maybe I didn’t receive a visit from the revenant spirit of John McCarthy, ghost of programming past, present and future. Or maybe I did.</p>

<p>Maybe Paul Graham just convinced me I was <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">coding in Blub</a>, for whatever value of Blub I happened to be using.</p>

<p>See, the thing about Blub is it’s a mutable value. When you’re using C++ and Java comes along, you realize C++ was actually Blub. When you’re using Perl for your day-to-day and discover Python, and then Ruby, you realize that not only was Python Blub, but Perl was an even Blubbier Blub.</p>

<p>Ruby… oh, Ruby. I still love Ruby. But then something happened.</p>

<p>I need to backpedal a bit.</p>

<p>There’s <em>using</em> a language, and then there’s <em>building</em> something in it. I’d played with Scheme (<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> is wonderful), and even Common Lisp, and I knew enough to appreciate the Lisp-nature of Ruby which, when combined with its Smalltalk-nature, I thought made for hte perfect productive language.</p>

<p>But see, I was <em>building</em> things in Ruby while I was <em>playing</em> with Lisp.</p>

<p>Along comes Clojure.</p>

<p>I was working in a pretty isolated programming role that granted me a lot of de facto autonomy. So when I got a request for a new service, I thought “why not Clojure?”</p>

<p>We’re in late 2012 here, so bear with me.</p>

<p>My first Clojure project ran like a champ, was hailed as an unqualified success. Eventually I even <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2013/02/03/datetime-conversions-in-clojure/">blogged about</a> a piece of that project that handled datetimes.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to the present, I’ve written Clojure in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, mostly <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> with the help of some awesome plugins from <a href="https://github.com/tpope">Tim Pope</a>.</p>

<p>Like I <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2014/10/23/welcome-to-the-dark-side-switching-to-emacs/">mentioned before</a>, I’ve had a religious hatred for Emacs since the mid-1990s when I entered the *nix world and got involved in USENET.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/freebsdgirl">@freebsdgirl</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/darkuncle">@darkuncle</a> ...and on that day, war broke out, destroying the fragile peace that had been brokered so long ago.</p>&mdash; jason λewis (@canweriotnow) <a href="https://twitter.com/canweriotnow/status/527532324234489857">October 29, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The war is far from over…</p>

<p>…but, I digress.</p>

<p>I started the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Clojure/">Baltimore Clojure Meetup</a> and met more Emacs users than I had in one place in a long time. Again, I dismissed Emacs.</p>

<p>That is, until I found <a href="http://lighttable.com/">LightTable</a> completely b0rked again and threw up my hands.</p>

<p>Perhaps I shouldn’t have eaten my hands to begin with… sorry, equivocation humor. Can’t resist.</p>

<h2 id="welcome-to-emacs">Welcome to Emacs</h2>

<p>So yeah, I went over my starter packages in the <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2014/10/23/welcome-to-the-dark-side-switching-to-emacs/">earlier post</a>, but I didn’t talk about the full experience of discovery I underwent when I fully committed to emacs.</p>

<p>Sure, there’s the whole <code>cider-mode</code> and <code>cider-jack-in</code> and <code>cider-nrepl</code> and even <code>cider-scratch</code> that make LightTable’s inline evaluation modes look like child’s play (no offense to Chris Granger, LightTable is beautiful, I love it, but… y’know, Emacs).</p>

<p>So I did those things, started with <a href="http://batsov.com/prelude/">Prelude</a>, added all the Clojure fun I could find, and got to work.</p>

<p>I also subscribed to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs">/r/emacs</a>, and did a little reading on the <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/">Emacs Wiki</a>.</p>

<p>Have you ever been comfortably reading (or coding) under a tree, and you see a white rabbit in a waistcoat with a pocket-watch run by complaining he’s late?</p>

<p>Thus such adventures begin.</p>

<h2 id="eat-me--drink-me">EAT ME / DRINK ME</h2>

<p>As I fell to the bottom (or so I thought) of the rabbit-hole, I found a bottle of <code>cider</code> labeled <em>Drink Me,</em> and so I drank the <code>cider</code>. Suddenly, I could eval Clojure inline, jump to docstrings, jump to source for a fn, and it was wonderful.</p>

<p>The last time I tried Emacs, I always joked about how I was using Emacs but always edited my .emacs config with Vim.</p>

<p>“Not this time,” I thought, and used <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Projectile">Projectile</a> to manage my <code>.emacs.d</code> and edited my <code>user.el</code> in Emacs. Oh, it was better! Then, thought I, I should put my <code>.emacs.d</code> in source control (actually, it was demanded:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/canweriotnow">@canweriotnow</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/willowdower">@willowdower</a> Now you must post your config on github so that we may critique it.</p>&mdash; Alex Redington (@holy_chao) <a href="https://twitter.com/holy_chao/status/511574770388041728">September 15, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>…yeah).</p>

<p>But then I realized I was doing the <code>⌘-Tab</code> to iTerm to run <code>git ci -a</code> (I pity the fool that doesn’t alias common git commoands) in… wait for it… <code>$EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim</code>.</p>

<p>That’s when I found a bit of fairy cake called <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/Magit">magit</a>, and I ate a bit of that and my Git workflow was inside of Emacs. Now it was a simple <code>M-x magit-status</code> to view my working tree state, where I could hit <code>s</code> to stage files for commit, and <code>C-c C-c</code> to commit changes, and <code>P P</code> to push.</p>

<p>Oh, it’s beautiful.</p>

<h2 id="curiouser-and-curiouser">Curiouser and Curiouser</h2>

<p>Well, if Emacs can handle my Git workflow, what <em>can’t</em> it do, I wondered?</p>

<p>I went a bit mad playing with multiple buffer and frame layouts; on one occasion I opened a shell inside an emacs biffer and launched the command-line version of emacs in a shell inside the windowed version of emacs.</p>

<p>Recursive rabbit holes.</p>

<p>When you’re running the Cocoa-nested version of Emacs (not Aquamacs, fuck that noise, but just GNU Emacs packaged as a .app), you get some suggestions from the menus. Gnus for USENET or email, various games, a calendar…</p>

<p>Calendar?</p>

<p>That’s whan I discovered Org-Mode.</p>

<h2 id="org-mode-ftw">Org-Mode FTW</h2>

<p><a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> is an Emacs major mode that lets you organize your life. All of it. I’m not even going into detail here, it’s a deep, deep well. You can use it for a TODO list, sync it with your phone, use it <a href="http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2014/03/05/octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode-v2/">to write</a> your <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress blog</a>.</p>

<p>(Confession: This blog is powered by octopress, and although it’s now written in Emacs, I’ve not gone full crazy and started composing it with Org-Mode)</p>

<h2 id="twittering-mode-wtf">Twittering-Mode WTF</h2>

<p>That’s when I started going down the tunnel of “well, what <em>else</em> can it do?”</p>

<p>And I discovered <code>twittering-mode</code>.</p>

<p>A quick <code>M-x package-install RET twittering-mode</code> puts a Twitter client in your text editor. Like you always needed. <code>M-x twit</code> will jump you right into your Twitter feed, <code>i</code> will enable user icons (yes, user avatars right in goddamn Emacs), and <code>u</code> will jump you to a buffer where you can compose a Tweet and hit <code>C-c C-c</code> to send it.</p>

<h2 id="playing-games">Playing Games</h2>

<p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that <code>M-x package-install RET 2048-mode</code> will install a game of 2048 in Emacs. Because that’s really fucking important, you know?</p>

<p><strong>Sigh</strong></p>

<p>For good reason, Emacs comes standard with an AI psychotherapist named Eliza.</p>

<p>A quick <code>M-x doctor</code> and you’re in therapy.</p>

<p>Which you’ll probably need.</p>

<h2 id="and-much-much-more">…and Much, Much More</h2>

<p>I’ve barely scratched the surface, but I feel like this post is long enough. There’s so much down here, down the Emacs rabbit hole, that it will probably take me weeks to even catch up to whre I am right now; what I’ve described so far is my first few days with this ~~operating system~~ text editor.</p>

<p>But it’s a fun ride.</p>

<h3 id="postscript">Postscript</h3>

<p>Sorry for the Tolkien digression when my dominant allusion was <em>Alice in Wonderland…</em> Emacs is a weird place.</p>
