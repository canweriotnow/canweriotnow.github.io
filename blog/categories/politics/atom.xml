    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other night Twitter was abuzz with controversy and drama, as per usual. One of those threads (which I&rsquo;ll get to momentarily) invovled what I&rsquo;ll refer to as &ldquo;employer-tattling,&rdquo; and <a href="https://twitter.com/soederpop">Jon Soeder</a> (laudably without drawing attention to the ongoing echo chamber), tweeted this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet center" lang="en"><p>If somebody says something vile on the internet, it is not your place to notify their employer. You are setting a terrible precedent.</p>&mdash; your boy jon soeder (@soederpop) <a href="https://twitter.com/soederpop/statuses/475127514655100929">June 7, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t mention which Twitter thread prompted this, but I have an educated guess.</p>

<h3>Last Friday Night</h3>

<p>Someone called <a href="https://twitter.com/shanley">Shanley Kane</a> a cunt. Okay, it was <a href="https://twitter.com/zivcjs">Ash Taylor</a>, lest I be accused of omitting details. Apparently, he quickly thought better of it and deleted the tweet, but Shanley got a screenshot!</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet center" lang="en"><p>so <a href="https://twitter.com/zivcjs">@zivcjs</a>, who works for <a href="https://twitter.com/Livestream">@livestream</a> under <a href="https://twitter.com/maxhaot">@maxhaot</a>, deleted his tweets calling me a cunt but screenshots <a href="https://t.co/UfLYcuhoFs">pic.twitter.com/UfLYcuhoFs</a></p>&mdash; Shanley (@shanley) <a href="https://twitter.com/shanley/statuses/475066367956103168">June 7, 2014</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>Using that kind of language (in general, but particularly in a public, online forum such as Twitter) is offensive, inexcusable, and basically stupid. My guess is that Ash realized this when he deleted the tweet.</p>

<p>Ash also <a href="http://zi.vc/apology.html">apologized publicly</a> to Shanley and <a href="https://twitter.com/ashedryden">Ashe Dryden</a> (also mentioned in the offending tweet), even after <a href="https://twitter.com/livestream">Livestream</a> fired him.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been pointed out in the related <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7865425">Hacker News thread</a> that Shanley herself is not known for shying away from <a href="https://medium.com/about-work/finding-out-youre-a-sexist-misogynistic-homophobic-classist-racist-asshole-and-hypocrite-f986fbd5e51f">name-calling</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ryan/status/474791621100199936">ad hominem</a> attacks.</p>

<p>But the point of this post isn&rsquo;t whether unproductive and childish name-calling (sexist or not) should be acceptable in public discourse; it&rsquo;s about employer-tattling, and its rather disturbing implications.</p>

<h3>Playground Rules</h3>

<p>My first concern about employer-tattling is the infantilizing effect it has both on the offended party, and on public discourse in general. This decline of agency implies a troubling transfer of responsibility from individuals to institutions. One would hope that adults functioning in the public sphere would have the maturity both to own their words (and mistakes), and appropriately respond to criticism — and difficult though it may be, sometimes ignoring trolls is the most productive response.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png">http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png</a>&#8221; title=&#8221;Duty Calls&#8221; ></p>

<p>Increasingly, we&rsquo;re seeing a tendency to run to the nearest &ldquo;adult&rdquo; to plead for them to punish the offending party. And in a world of adults behaving like spoiled children, the next relative equivalent to an adult (i.e., position of power or authority) is either the State or, if no laws have been broken, a corporation.</p>

<h3>Corporations aren&rsquo;t just people, they&rsquo;re parents</h3>

<p>At least, that&rsquo;s the message this sort of tactic sends. I find it sadly ironic that supposed critics of institutionalized patriarchy (a very real and entrenched systemic problem in our society, particularly within capitalism itself), would deliberately reinforce the role of the corporation/employer as the judging, disciplining Father archetype.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post-img/1984.jpg"></p>

<p>I want to make it clear (if it isn&rsquo;t already) that this post is not intended as an attack on anyone, but as an externalization of my bewilderment at whether those who employ this tactic have fully thought through the implications of doing so.</p>

<p>Many of the people who seem to think this tactic is acceptable also tend to express a commitment to class politics (as well as politics of race and gender, and their intersectionality). This is a tactic that demonstrates a shocking lack of class solidarity. Deliberately attempting to destroy the employment or employability of a fellow worker out of spite is inexcusable.</p>

<p>Appealing to capital to enforce one&rsquo;s political agenda (no matter how noble that agenda might be) implicitly places that agenda as reliant upon and subject to capital itself. It&rsquo;s just plain bad politics.</p>

<p>And as Jon points out, it sets a terrible precedent. It expands the role of the employer to managing the totality of our lives, rather than limiting that influence to our professional lives. It changes us from professionals into frightened children.</p>

<h3>A culture of fear</h3>

<p>The prospect that one could lose one&rsquo;s livelihood, threatening the safety and security of one&rsquo;s family, over an online discussion, has a chilling, Orwellian feel. It&rsquo;s actually worse than that: whereas Orwell envisioned an omnipotent State punishing &ldquo;thoughtcrime,&rdquo; we have an emergent culture of fear in which no state intervention is necessary. The NSA might be reading my email, but they&rsquo;re not likely to get me fired.</p>

<p>I know whereof I speak. Some months ago, I was involved in a Twitter conversation about a study that showed that women on IRC were more likely to be harassed than men. While this seemed perfectly reasonable an observation, I (among others) had some questions about the methodology (e.g., literally women, or users with female-sounding handles, etc.). Attempting to inject some levity into what was becoming a tense discussion (something I would do IRL), I made an offhand reference to Rule 30 from the <a href="http://rulesoftheinternet.com/index.php?title=Main_Page">Rules of The Internet</a>, i.e., &ldquo;There are NO girls on the internet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not expect the vitriolic reaction that ensued, and once I realized that people had genuinely taken offense, I apologized. I did not verbally attack anyone or do anything but have a civil conversation about this one study, but I made a reference to a stupid meme without thinking anyone would react beyond eye-rolling.</p>

<p>A couple of days later, my COO, <a href="https://twitter.com/teachingdaisy">Margaret Roth</a> asked me about a weird voicemail she had received. Someone had called claiming to be interested in our company&rsquo;s services, but then went on at length saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you know what&rsquo;s going on in your development team, but your CTO tweeted that there were no women on the internet, and I&rsquo;m very concerned about the type of employees that you&rsquo;re hiring.&rdquo; No name or number left (odd for someone supposedly interested in the company&rsquo;s services), just accusations of poor management and supervision.</p>

<p>Upon reflection for this post, Margaret said, &ldquo;It was ridiculous that I was getting a call about this at all, let alone without citation. It&rsquo;s not my responsibility to police what you say on social media, especially in a case when I&rsquo;m getting blindly harassed for my management skills. If someone wanted to have an adult conversation with me about this, I&rsquo;d be happy to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m lucky enough to work for someone who treats me like an adult as well as a professional, and doesn&rsquo;t respond to anonymous attempts at character assassination, but it was a rather disturbing experience for both of us, and not everyone is so lucky.</p>

<p>I backed off from participation on Twitter for some time after that incident. It&rsquo;s never pleasant to be reminded that participating openly on the internet can (and often does) result in being doxxed and/or harassed in &ldquo;real life.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/whit537">@whit537</a> not everyone is in the privileged position of being able to have all kinds of shit on the internet &quot;openly&quot; w/out getting harassed</p>&mdash; Shanley (@shanley) <a href="https://twitter.com/shanley/statuses/467089426741338112">May 15, 2014</a></blockquote>

<h3>The decline of agency</h3>

<p>This is the first of (what I intend to be) a series of posts on what I perceive to be a decline of the concept of agency in socio-politico-cultural discourse. Whether it&rsquo;s the instant recourse to public Twitter-shaming rather than civil dialogue of <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2013/03/23/donglegate/">Donglegate</a>, or the infantilizing trend of employer-tattling, we are seeing a retreat from personal agency and a shift toward character assassination, public intimidation, and creating a culture of fear that is inimical to productive public discourse and debate. I can&rsquo;t speculate as to whether such discourse is even valued by the practitioners of these tactics, but one can&rsquo;t help but wonder.</p>

<p>Ash Taylor was just plain wrong to (publically or otherwise) refer to Shanley and Ashe as cunts. No excuse. But should he have gotten fired over it? Well, I suppose that&rsquo;s up to his (now former) employer, Livestream. But I wonder if Livestream would have reacted so quickly and drastically if they hadn&rsquo;t been prodded by such a polarizing figure with a degree of celebrity in the internet echo chamber.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also a bit interesting that the founder and CEO of Feminist Technology Collective, Inc. (i.e., someone who <em>cannot</em> be fired) is trying to get people fired and doesn&rsquo;t see (or willfully ignores, or gleefully exploits, but let&rsquo;s generously hope it&rsquo;s an innocent blind spot) the inherent privilege gap in that scenario. But that&rsquo;s a topic for another post.</p>

<p><em>The author would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/soederpop">Jon Soeder</a> for pushing me to finally write this, and <a href="https://twitter.com/teachingdaisy">Margaret Roth</a> for her editorial guidance and support.</em></p>

<p>Update: Comments are <a href="/blog/2014/06/10/on-comments-and-moderation/">now closed</a>, but there&rsquo;s plenty of discussion over on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7869644">Hacker News</a>.</p>

    <updated>2013-06-21T11:42:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://decomplecting.org/blog/2013/06/21/the-importance-of-aarons-law</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, Rep. Zoe Lofgren and Rep. Ron Wyden introduced a bill, known as &ldquo;Aaron&rsquo;s Law&rdquo;, which amends the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)</a>, a 1986 bil which set most of the &ldquo;cybercrime&rdquo; statutes on the books today. This law, affectionately known as <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title18/html/USCODE-2010-title18-partI-chap47-sec1030.htm">U.S. Code Title 18, Part I, Chapter 47, §1030</a>, has been added to many times over the years (via the PATRIOT Act, and various bills related to issues of identity theft, etc.), but the substantial core of the bill has remained the same since 1986: vague, ominous, overly broad, and a rampant playground for prosecutorial misconduct.</p>

<p>A quick recap of the origins of Aaron&rsquo;s Law, just in case there are readers outside my usual demographic of nerds and hackers: Aaron Swartz was a brilliant programmer and activist who co-authored the RSS specification as a teenager, went on to co-found <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> and <a href="http://demandprogress.org">Demand Progress</a>, and so much more. Chagrined by the lack of public access to (especially taxpayer-funded) research, he went on to use MIT&rsquo;s computer network to (illegally) download millions of academic papers from JSTOR. MIT and JSTOR both declined to press charges, but federal prosecutors Carmen Ortiz and Stephen Haymann smelled blood in the water and attacked like frenzied piranha-sharks. okay, those don&rsquo;t exist, but I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a single creature vicious enough to describe this dastardly duo. Faced with 35 years in federal prison, Aaron, sadly, took his own life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not here to rehash the whole case or go over what should have happened differently. The hacker community mourns the loss of Aaron Swartz, each of us in our own way. But I do want to address the technical, economic, and even pedagogical consequences of the CFAA in its current state, and why its amendment is so vital.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>A history of abuse</h3>

<p>Aaron Swartz was not the first victim of the CFAA, but may be its first public fatality. In <em>The Hacker Crackdown,</em> Bruce Sterling desccribes the rampant excesses of &ldquo;Operation Sundevil,&rdquo; an all-out raid on &ldquo;hackers&rdquo; that occurred in the late 1980&rsquo;s. There&rsquo;s a good <a href="http://gawker.com/5975889/the-death-of-aaron-swartz-and-the-new-hacker-crackdown">piece on Gawker</a> that describes that incident and how it relates to Aaron&rsquo;s case.</p>

<p>A funny thing happens when someone begins to deeply <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/G/grok.html">grok</a> computer systems, especially at the level of code. It opens a new world of possibilities, and ignites an insatiable curiosity. A curiosity which is often &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; when exploration takes one beyond one&rsquo;s own sandbox.</p>

<p>I got my first modem at the age of ten or eleven, and quickly left the BBS world when I got my first real (UNIX shell) internet account. I won&rsquo;t go into details (not sure what the statute of limitations is!), but I&rsquo;m <em>certain</em> some of what I got up to ran afoul of the CFAA, to put it mildly. I was a burgeoning hacker, not a cracker; I was never malicious, tried to follow the &ldquo;Boy Scout rule&rdquo; (always leave the campground better than you found it), and even left anonymous tips for the administrators of systems that I, uh, accessed, telling them how I got in and pointing them to a patch if I knew of one.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to think that, in the process of learning volumes about programming, systems, networks, etc., I actually helped to improve security.</p>

<h3>The next generation of hackers</h3>

<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2013/06/02/were-not-ready-to-teach-kids-to-code/">last post</a>, I&rsquo;m really interested in the push to teach kids real programming skills. But what happens when we&rsquo;re giving kids the tools to send themselves to federal prison because of some outdated, vague laws that prosecutors love to abuse in order to &lsquo;make examples&rsquo; of individuals whose only real crime is curiosity and a desire for open access to information?</p>

<p>When we open the world of programming to kids, we&rsquo;re really creating the next generation of hackers. Not in the media-hyped, perjorative sense, but in the standard meaning, established by <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1392">RFC1392</a>: &ldquo;A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>A legislative pull request</h3>

<p>In a way, the body of laws forms the source code for our democracy; sadly, the compilers (lawyers and judges) are buggy as all hell and don&rsquo;t raise warnings until it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

<p>In Aaron Swartz&rsquo;s case, we had a prosecutorial buffer overrun that caused the target process (Aaron) to segfault. It&rsquo;s time to patch this piece of source code with the amendments contained in Aaron&rsquo;s Law. It&rsquo;s just a patch, and I&rsquo;d say we need better code review (in this case, public code review actually occured via Reddit, setting an interesting precedent) in general, until we have perfect compilers &mdash; and I don&rsquo;t see perfect lawyers or judges arriving any time soon.</p>

<p>Open source works; sunlight is the best disinfectant; transparency is desirable. When our elected representatives legislate out of fear or confusion (CFAA, PATRIOT, etc.), we get bad laws that imprison our best and brightest, or worse, take them from us completely.</p>

<p>Please go to the <a href="http://act.demandprogress.org/sign/aarons_law_intro/">Demand Progress site for Aaron&rsquo;s Law</a> to become a citizen co-sponsor of the bill &ndash; it might be a measure too late for Aaron, but it&rsquo;s necessary for the future.</p>
