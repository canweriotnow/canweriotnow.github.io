    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3><em>Or, &ldquo;Human Contact as a Premium Service&rdquo;</em></h3>

<p>Last year, I wrote a mildly controversial bit of satire called <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2013/03/11/confessions-of-a-job-destroyer/">&ldquo;Confessions of a Job Destroyer&rdquo;</a>, in which I &ldquo;lamented&rdquo; my role in the automation of tasks formerly done by humans.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, I was reading <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> a bit more than usual, and there were a number of fascinating posts and comment threads à propos to the topic, so I feel it&rsquo;s time I revisited it with the snark dialed down below 11.</p>

<p>First, there was <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/wealth-poverty/what-did-tech-ceo-say-worker-he-wanted-automate">&ldquo;What did the tech CEO say to the worker he wanted to automate?&rdquo;</a>, a follow-up on <a href="http://uservoice.com">UserVoice</a> CEO Richard White&rsquo;s comments re the BART strike last year:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>My solution would be to pay whatever the hell they want, get them back to work, and then go figure out how to automate all their jobs.</p><footer><strong>Richard White <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/wealth-poverty/what-did-tech-ceo-say-worker-he-wanted-automate">http://www.marketplace.org/topics/wealth-poverty/what-did-tech-ceo-say-worker-he-wanted-automate</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>In TFA, White accompanies a journalist to a BART station and has a conversation with a station attendant, about her feelings toward the proposition that her job be automated. There&rsquo;s some disagreement on how much &ldquo;the human factor&rdquo; matters in the role, but her response is instructive for the purposes of this article.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>But if her job was automated, I asked.  What would she do?  She thought about it for a moment.</p></p><p><p>“I would do my hobby,” Landry said. “Hair and make-up. And buy and sell houses.”</p></p><p><p>Then White was the one smiling.  “See?” he said.  “Wouldn&rsquo;t that be perfect if she could actually pursue her hobby?”</p></p><p><p>And that does sound great.  But it&rsquo;s not what seems to be happening in the New Economy, at least not yet.</p></p><p><p></p><footer><strong>&ldquo;What did the tech CEO say to the worker he wanted to automate?&rdquo; <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/wealth-poverty/what-did-tech-ceo-say-worker-he-wanted-automate">http://www.marketplace.org/topics/wealth-poverty/what-did-tech-ceo-say-worker-he-wanted-automate</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll return to this, but I wanted to point to the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6312100">HN comments thread</a>, which is a particularly (unusually?) good read.</p>

<p>White&rsquo;s comments provoked two responses on the labor front earlier this year, which I also want to link while I&rsquo;m on the subject. A pro-labor, anti-tech-entrepreneur article from <a href="http://salon.com">Salon.com</a> entitled <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/07/08/silicon_valley_is_stoking_the_wrong_kind_of_revolution/">&ldquo;Silicon Valley is stoking the wrong kind of revolution&rdquo;</a>, and an anti-labor, pro-tech-entrepreneur article from <a href="http://techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a> called <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/29/why-labor-unions-and-silicon-valley-arent-friends-in-2-charts/">&ldquo;Why Labor Unions And Silicon Valley Aren’t Friends, In 2 Charts&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>While both are interesting and make valid points, both also suffer from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">false dilemma fallacy</a>. Labor and technology aren&rsquo;t enemies; labor and capital are enemies, but only if you have a conception of human rights and human dignity. And technology actually provides a solution, if we can overcome certain of our baser tendencies.</p>

<p>The second thread on HN that prompted this post was a <a href="http://dangerousminds.net/comments/america_is_awash_in_money_yet_poverty_grows_we_need_a_basic_income">new call for a Basic Income Guarantee</a> (HN comment thread <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6309882">here</a>).</p>

<h2>Goodbye, Middle Class</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d already been mulling a return to this topic for a while since <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/515926/how-technology-is-destroying-jobs/">&ldquo;How Technology is Destroying Jobs&rdquo;</a> appeared in the <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com">MIT Technology Review</a>, and David Graeber&rsquo;s article <a href="http://www.strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/">&ldquo;On The Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs&rdquo;</a> appeared on <a href="http://www.strikemag.org">Strike!</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a growing consensus among economists, anthropologists, and technologists that:</p>

<ol>
<li>We&rsquo;re seeing economic displacement unknown since the Industrial Revolution</li>
<li>Actually, it&rsquo;s different this time and we&rsquo;re not sure why</li>
<li>Moderately-skilled, white-collar jobs (the bread and butter of the middle class) are only going to be hit harder and harder</li>
<li>The jobs available are diverging into top-paying &ldquo;creative&rdquo; sectors, and low-wage &ldquo;bullshit jobs&rdquo;</li>
<li>What the fuck do we do about it?</li>
</ol>


<p>I think that&rsquo;s where a lot of this <a href="http://code.org">&ldquo;OMG EVERYONE LEARN TO CODE&rdquo;</a> impetus stems from, and while I am a vocal proponent of the absolute importance of <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2013/06/02/were-not-ready-to-teach-kids-to-code/">computational literacy</a>, I&rsquo;m not sure this is a solution for anyone except the companies who have forgotten the bad old days of &ldquo;commodity programmers.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Automata(tion) Theory</h2>

<p>If you have any kind of CS background, you can&rsquo;t look at the word &ldquo;automation&rdquo; without seeing the word &ldquo;automata.&rdquo; This is something I&rsquo;ve been pondering of late.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>The franchise and the virus work on the same principle, what thrives in one place will thrive in another. You just have to find a sufficiently virulent business plan, condense it into a three-ring binder ― its DNA ― Xerox it, and embed it in the fertile line of a well-traveled highway, preferably one with a left turn lane. Then the growth will expand until it runs up against its property lines.</p><footer><strong>Neal Stephenson</strong> <cite>Snow Crash <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/493634-snow-crash">http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/493634-snow-crash</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>At the beginning of Neal Stephenson&rsquo;s cyberpunk classic <em>Snow Crash</em> there&rsquo;s a great description of franchises &ndash; every policy and procedure down to the last detail is laid out in a series of three-ring binders which must be adhered to precisely, without deviation. When an edge case crops up (been a while since I read it, I think there was a bomb or fire), the manager, instead of responding, starts flipping through binders to figure out the response protocol.</p>

<p>Long ago and in another life (high school), I worked at Starbucks. Back then, we had to walk uphill both ways in three feet of snow to the espresso machine. Okay, not really, but we were using 4-group, hand-tamped machines, and you had to be able to calibrate the grind, adjust your tamp for conditions down to the ambient humidity, and use a combination of sound, feel, and an analog thermometer to steam and foam the milk properly. A perfect cappuccino was something you could feel proud of. And now&hellip; button pushing. I am in no way trying to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction">reclaim the aura</a>, but there is a qualitative difference in the job of a barista now versus then (I picked on Starbucks in the previous post &ndash; nothing personal, but it&rsquo;s illustrative). Actually, this is a &ldquo;same old shit&rdquo; phenomenon: consider Marx&rsquo;s contrast of the artisan and the industrial proletariat in <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch32.htm">Chapter 32 of <em>Capital</em></a>.</p>

<p>But even in those days, a Starbucks store was the implementation of a set of instructions contained in countless three-ring binders. Everything from staffing to customer handoff to drink preparation was in those binders. If I&rsquo;d known then what I know now (oh, how many times will I utter that phrase?), I could have (conceivably) described the workings of an entire store as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram">state diagram</a>.</p>

<p>Seriously: if you have humans enacting a rote set of instructions, what you want is not a person, what you want is a <em>compiler.</em></p>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<h2>Human Contact as a Premium Service</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m almost giddy about the prospects of going shopping or grabbing a quick lunch without having to interact with humans. Like many hackers, I fall somewhere on the high-functioning end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum">autism spectrum</a>, so I try not to generalize my own preferences in this regard. But I think many people would like to be able to go out without being hassled by salespeople, oozed on with the fake charm of an overly unctuous waiter, or encounter a surly, inefficient gatekeeper to the renewal of a driver&rsquo;s licence. I do as much of my shopping online as possible in order to avoid these scenarios, but sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to get out of the house, and <em>not</em> for the chance to encounter strange humans who are just going to spoil the experience anyhow.</p>

<p>Then sometimes, it&rsquo;s different. I tend not to put a lot of time and effort into clothing. I was once really into fashion, to be honest, but I just don&rsquo;t see the point anymore. My brain and fingers have the economic value; I&rsquo;m most comfortable in jeans and a nerdy T-shirt. But when I&rsquo;m looking for something special or fancy&hellip; you can&rsquo;t beat <a href="http://www.saksfifthavenue.com/">Saks Fifth Avenue</a>. Shopping at Saks warrants a trip to NYC in and of itself. Every single time, the salesman (not to be sexist, but in the Men&rsquo;s Store, it&rsquo;s usually a salesman) typically will direct me in the first five minutes to something I wouldn&rsquo;t have even glanced at myself, but that looks better on me than skin on Lady Godiva, and feels like butter. And if I&rsquo;m picky, I&rsquo;ll have my hand held and my every question and concern adressed for the duration of the expedition. I think they gave me an 18 year old scotch while the tailor was chalking adjustments on one trip.</p>

<p>And yes, it&rsquo;s expensive. But these were skilled craftsmen &ndash; and I&rsquo;m not speaking only of the tailor, who was, yes, and artist) &ndash; but also of the salesmen, who knew their stock and knew my size, shape, and style at 50 paces. This is a premium service, and something a retail droid will not approximate until they become self-aware and overthrow us.</p>

<p>Likewise, consider Burger King versus a small bistro: at the former, do I give a fuck whether a teenager or an automaton enters my order?</p>

<p>Actually, I probably do: a robot is more likely to be accurate, ensuring I have it &ldquo;my way, right away, at Burger King now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the other hand, do I want an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system">expert system</a> suggesting a wine pairing for my pan-fried sweetbreads with haricots verts in a citrus beurre blanc? Not that I don&rsquo;t like automated wine-pairing apps, but I want a damn sommelier to advise me that in this instance, the 2006 Riesling is a better match than the 2003 Sauvignon Blanc.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a premium. It&rsquo;s why we go to places like Saks or a pricey bistro. And it&rsquo;s why I think there will always be places for human interaction in retail, restaurants, etc., even if we eliminate humans at the commodity level.</p>

<h2>Marx, Unions, and the Labor Situation</h2>

<p>Personal statement here: I &lt;3 labor unions, I believe in them, I want to ragequit this country everytime a douchecanoe like Scott Walker gets elected. That being said&hellip; Marx saw that trade unions are not enough, the <a href="http://www.iww.org/">IWW</a> is awesome but, let&rsquo;s be honest, still mostly a historical society for anarcho-syndicalists, and, one must admit, unions were a specific historical response to the commodification of labor.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re now at a point that commodity labor is being replaced by commodity software&hellip; and that <em>has the potential to be</em> a good thing. The idea that human activity can be commodified should be offensive to human dignity. Sadly, in this country in particular, we&rsquo;ve been beholden to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic">Protestant work-ethic</a> (viz. the above-cited Graeber article on &ldquo;bullshit jobs&rdquo;) and refused to acknowledge that dignity should not be about work (better expressed in Joules) but <em>creativity.</em></p>

<p>So, the increasing polarisation of work? Creatives at the top, automatons at the bottom? There have been commendable attempts by fast-food workers to unionize, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/09/02/fast_food_strikes_low_wage_female_workers_are_driving_this_labor_movement.html">striking for higher wages</a>, but I expect this will only drive the incentive to automate those jobs out of existence, as the technology catches up with the economic need (of the bosses, the only economic need that matters in the short term). On the other hand, there are clarion calls for technologists to <a href="http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/11/18/programmers-dont-need-a-union-we-need-a-profession/">self-recognize as a profession</a>, since every attempt to commodotize our work has been an abject (and dreadfully expensive) failure.</p>

<p>Where does that leave us?</p>

<p>We need professions, with codes of ethics, basic standards of professional development, etc., among the new economy professions. We need unions for all commodity labor, agitating for higher wages while those jobs exist, and continuing the fight for displaced workers when commodity jobs are automated. But what we need most of all&hellip;</p>

<h2>The Basic Income Guarantee (BIG)</h2>

<p>I was astonished to learn recently that Milton Friedman, of all people, was on the presidential commission that recommended a BIG in 1969. If someone that far to the right could advocate something so seemingly &ldquo;socialist&hellip;&rdquo; wow. Then again, the right has swung so much further to the right since then that the GOP mainstream is somewhere between Pat Robertson and Adolf Hitler, making Friedman look like a damn hippie.</p>

<p>But the BIG solves many problems posed both by right-libertarian laissez-faire capitalism, and by the traditional welfare state. It doesn&rsquo;t penalize working (unlike TANF, SSDI, and SSI in the U.S.); it doesn&rsquo;t require endless bureaucracy just to apply (let&rsquo;s get rid of those social services jobs too, while we&rsquo;re replacing the MVA with robots), and it&rsquo;s egalitarian.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve read this far, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re smart enough to Google &lsquo;basic income guarantee&rsquo; (but just in case, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=basic+income+guarantee">let me Google that for you</a>), so I&rsquo;m not going to endlessly cite the studies demonstrating the economic benefits.</p>

<h2>MOOCs, Code.org, O RLY?</h2>

<p>I love the idea that we (as a society) are lowering the barrier to entry of professions like software development, design, etc. With free online courses (and even cheap (but awesome) paid classes like <a href="http://codeschool.com">CodeSchool</a>), it&rsquo;s easier than ever to level up in lucrative skill sets. If you have the time.</p>

<p><blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>It is clear then that there are branches of learning and education which we must study merely with a view to leisure spent in intellectual activity, and these are to be valued for their own sake; whereas those kinds of knowledge which are useful in business are to be deemed necessary, and exist for the sake of other things.</p></p><p><p></p><footer><strong>Aristotle</strong> <cite>Politics <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.8.eight.html">http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.8.eight.html</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Aristotle viewed leisure as a necessary precondition for the pursuit of philosophy, an intellectual pursuit which should be considered its own <em>telos</em> (If you&rsquo;re new to this blog, full confession: I was a Philosophy major, and there my heart still lies).</p>

<p>But without artisans or guilds, or even (harsh though it was) indentured servitude, where lies the time to learn a new profession? If keeping body and soul together occupy 40, 60, 80 hours a week, where lies the time to develop the mental faculties to grok computer science, to learn Ruby or Clojure, to practice this arcane art?</p>

<p>Let me put it to you this way: I&rsquo;m the CTO of a very cool and very fun edtech company. I also have a nine month old daughter at home. Both are incredibly enjoyable and fulfilling, but&hellip; my time for open source hacking? Pretty limited at the moment.</p>

<p>And I sit at a desk coding most of the day. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine flipping burgers for eight hours, going home to have a sandwich, going to a second job, coming home again, and trying to do homework.</p>

<p>A basic income would provide the padding to re-skill a de-skilled workforce, return dignity to actual work, and let us not behave like savages, because the root cause of most of our social ills is poverty.</p>

<p>Our productivity as a society is the highest in history. Let&rsquo;s acknowledge that we all contribute in one way or another, and that we should all have the opportunity (at least) to reach for the stars.</p>

<p>Or, if you&rsquo;re convinced that this is a meritocracy and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re at the top&hellip; let me introduce a concept that we never should have forgotten&hellip; and one that you neglect at your own peril: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noblesse_oblige"><em>noblesse oblige</em></a>.</p>

    <updated>2012-07-18T19:59:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://decomplecting.org/blog/2012/07/18/higher-education-needs-a-revolution</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://coursera.com">Coursera</a> announced that 12 more universities had joined their program of creating massive open online courses, or MOOCs (one of them was <a href="http://www.jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a>, where I work, so I was especially excited&hellip; we&rsquo;re not always &ldquo;early adopters&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Coursera is extremely cool. I&rsquo;m currently taking UC Berkely&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/saas">Software Engineering for SaaS</a> class (nothing new for me so far, but it&rsquo;s enjoyable), and I took the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">Machine Learning</a> class earlier this year. Well, most of it&hellip; I got a little too busy with work and family and didn&rsquo;t quite finish. But I still learned a lot, and used math I thought I&rsquo;d forgotten. So all in all, a win.</p>

<p>Not quite finishing is a common thread in my life. I&rsquo;m just a few credits away from a Bachelor&rsquo;s in philosophy. Also, graphic design. Probably computer science as well. My Achilles' heel was always General Education courses. I want to learn almost everything I possibly can, but generally I either want to learn something so I can do something with it, or learn something because I have a compelling fascination with the topic. Most Gen Ed courses did neither for me, and when I&rsquo;m not interested, I&rsquo;m not motivated. This might be a character flaw. Two universities so far seemed to think so.</p>

<p>It seems like the whole obsession with &ldquo;general education&rdquo; is dying. Johns Hopkins, for instance, has no general requirements, only departmental requirements for majors (and minors, natch). That&rsquo;s extremely cool. It also costs over US$50k a year to attend. That&rsquo;s not so cool.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Last year, Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun decided to offer their Stanford AI class online, for free. They didn&rsquo;t tell Stanford before they announced this, so there was a bit of a kerfuffle, but it happened. Another reminder of that all-important maxim:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.</p><footer><strong>Rear Adm. Dr. Grace Murray Hopper</strong> <cite>Chips Ahoy (July 1986)</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Anyhow, they had hoped for maybe 2,000 students. After a couple of weeks, they were at 58,000. After the New York Times covered the experiment, enrollment had soared to over 100,000.</p>

<p>Probably most didn&rsquo;t finish the class. But it was enough of a phenomenon that Thrun quit Stanford to found <a href="http://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>, another startup engaged in producing and distributing MOOCs (Coursera was founded by fellow Stanford computer scientists Deborah Koller and Andrew Ng). Add to this <a href="http://www.edxonline.org/">edX</a>, a MOOC-producing partnership of MIT and Harvard, and you have a significant trend in the world of Higher Ed.</p>

<h3>The End of Higher Ed?</h3>

<p>In Forbes, Susan Adams penned the alarmist-sounding <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2012/07/17/is-coursera-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-traditional-higher-education/">Is Coursera the Beginning of the End for Traditional Higher Education?</a>. But it&rsquo;s not nearly as alarming (if you&rsquo;re a higher ed institution) as the prediction by Sebastian Thrun from <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/03/ff_aiclass">an article in Wired last March</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Fifty years from now, according to Thrun, there will be only 10 institutions in the whole world that deliver higher education.</p><footer><strong>Sebastian Thrun</strong> <cite>Wired 20.03 <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/03/ff_aiclass/">http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/03/ff_aiclass/</a> &ldquo;The Stanford Education Experiment Could Change Higher Learning Forever&rdquo;</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Remember, this <em>is</em> the guy who built Google&rsquo;s self-driving car, so when he makes predictions about the future&hellip; I think it&rsquo;s wise to pay attention.</p>

<h3>Veritas vos liberabit</h3>

<p>Something to remember about our institutions of higher education: they&rsquo;re based on a model that emerged in the Middle Ages; Oxford and Cambridge were established for the teaching of Scholastic philosophy, primary to the clergy. This was long before Gutenberg&rsquo;s innovation of movable type, so books were rare and expensive, so it made sense to create centers where the books could be read to students, and discussed.</p>

<p>The Enlightenment shifted the focus to the natural sciences, and later the concept of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_education">liberal education</a> came to the fore. The system of general education requirements is based in this ideology. I won&rsquo;t debate the value of a liberal education, but it is worth analyzing its position as an anachronism.</p>

<p>Up until the 20th century, the idea that a university education was for anyone but the children of the aristocracy (or, at least, the bourgeoisie) would have seemed preposterous. But after the second World War, and the G.I. Bill, colleges were flooded with applicants newly able to afford the luxury of a liberal education. As business began to demand an influx of college graduates, public higher education expanded exponentially, to fill the demand of the children of the middle class for degrees needed to pursue lucrative careers.</p>

<p>Somewhere in this process, the focus of higher education shifted from liberal education to career preparation. It was the open secret of the entire higher ed system, but as long as general education nodded in the direction of a traditional liberal arts curriculum, it could remain an open secret.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>And the people in the houses<br/>All went to the university,<br/>Where they were put in boxes<br/>And they came out all the same,<br/>And there&rsquo;s doctors and lawyers,<br/>And business executives,<br/>And they&rsquo;re all made out of ticky tacky<br/>And they all look just the same.</p><footer><strong>Malvina Reynolds</strong> <cite>Little Boxes</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>In this process, however, the value of degrees was diluted. It&rsquo;s basic economics; in a system based on scarcity, the more of something there is, the less valuable it is. And so, the Bachelor&rsquo;s degree became the new high school diploma. And business discovered that a B.A. or B.S. didn&rsquo;t guarantee much, especially in technical fields.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post-img/thinks-college-degree.png" title="&ldquo;College Freshman Meme: Thinks College Degree Will Provide Him With Career&rdquo;" ></p>

<h3>Coding a Revolution</h3>

<p>Coursera, Udacity, and edX have the potential to create the first disruptive technology in the higher ed domain. Sure, the notion of online, collaborative courseware is nothing new. <a href="http://www.blackboard.com">Blackboard</a> has been milking this space for years, with a product reviled by students and faculty alike. But this is different. Blackboard is internal to higher ed institutions; these companies are taking learning out of the university, and making it available to anyone with an interest. Through software and course content sourced from experts in various fields, combined with certification programs, they have the potential to change the social meaning of higher education.</p>

<p>For centuries, the social value of a university education has been tied to the degrees conferred by an accredited institution. Accreditation is granted by organizations such as the <a href="http://www.msche.org/">Middle States Commission on Higher Education</a>, a unit of the <a href="http://www.middlestates.org/">Middle States Association of Colelges and Schools</a>, whose members are the schools themselves. Self-regulation works so well for the finance industry&hellip;</p>

<p>Coursera says they have no plan to offer degrees, only certificates from instructors (as opposed to institutions), so far. Although, the University of Washington is planning to offer credits in conjunction with their Coursera courses. So we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>Udacity, on the other hand, while not offering degrees, offers a (possibly) more rigorous certification process; rather than just passing the course, a student must take a certification exam in a testing center or online. This carries a fee, unlike Coursera&rsquo;s instructor certs. Probably not a bad business model (Coursera, for its part, doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a monetization strategy).</p>

<p>In either case, I think there&rsquo;s an element of shrewdness here. There&rsquo;s a principle that <a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/a/2339">&ldquo;specific coursework&hellip;does not belong in a CV.&rdquo;</a>. Of course, <em>certifications</em> are fair game. My intuition is that (particularly given the background of the principles) there&rsquo;s a push here away from degrees and toward domain-specific information on résumés and curricula vitae. For technical fields, I think it&rsquo;s not only brilliant, but past due.</p>

<p>For liberal arts and humanities&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure. Coursera and Udacity started off with computer science and engineering courses because it&rsquo;s easy to find a technical solution to grading programming exercises; basically, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>. If it builds and the tests pass, you&rsquo;ve passed the test. Fuzzy subjects are a little more difficult. But this is an early iteration, so anything is possible.</p>

<h3>The Value of College</h3>

<p>Many of the articles about Coursera over the past couple of days have followed a similar pattern. They discuss the disruptive (and democratizing) potential of Coursera, Udacity, and edX; they cover the significance of the buy-in from world-class research universities; and then they get kind of nostalgic, wondering if we won&rsquo;t lose something valuable if brick-and-mortar institutions fall by the wayside.</p>

<p>I think the college experience is something wonderful; I didn&rsquo;t even graduate, and I wouldn&rsquo;t trade my years at uni for anything&hellip; well, maybe a <a href="http://www.cray.com/Products/XK6/KX6.aspx">Cray XK6</a> all to myself. Not much I wouldn&rsquo;t do for that. But, I digress. The value of a brick-and-mortar institution isn&rsquo;t in the lectures; it&rsquo;s in the collaboration of like-minded individuals in the rarified environment of limited responsibility, educational opportunity, and funded research. Sort of like this:</p>

<p>Okay, maybe not like that. But there is something special about the college experience. Honestly, though, is it exclusive to college?</p>

<p>I lived in collective anarcho-punk houses for years after I dropped out of college&hellip; they&rsquo;re a lot like frat houses, but co-ed and without all the date rape. And actually, more studying.</p>

<p>I could imagine graduating from high school a few years from now, and deciding that I cared more about computer science than a B.S. in computer science. Taking CS 101 from Stanford on Coursera. Forming a local study group, with a few like-minded individuals. Then renting a big house, and continuing to take CS courses together. Hell, maybe saying &ldquo;screw these old guys who are into degrees, let&rsquo;s do a startup and make a billion dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just an idea. But hacker houses aren&rsquo;t that new an idea&hellip; <a href="http://farmhouse.la/">Farmhouse</a> in LA has been around for a while&hellip; it&rsquo;s apparently a big Silicon Valley trend, as well. Why not do that as students?</p>

<h3>What is to be done?</h3>

<p>Much of this is speculation. But ultimately, the effect of these startups is to democratize higher learning, to wrest it from the grasp of an elite and to provide it to anyone with internet access. And that&rsquo;s a good thing, whatever the consequences. I think we&rsquo;re in the midst of a transitional period in education, higher and otherwise.</p>

<p>My mother taught elementary school for thirty-odd years. I dragged her into the world of computers when I was a tiny kid, and she in turn dragged her school district (with some kicking and screaming). Institutional education is often change-averse, and a little coercion is usually required.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the participating institutions are even cognizant of the potential of this technology to revolutionize how higher ed functions. But ultimately, for the majority of the population, it is dysfunctional. Providing education to all, free of charge, is a social good, and a necessary progression. We&rsquo;ve needed this for a long time. We&rsquo;ve just been waiting on the technology. Now that it&rsquo;s here, there is no turning back. And that&rsquo;s good, too.</p>
