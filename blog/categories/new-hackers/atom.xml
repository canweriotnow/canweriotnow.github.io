    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I get it. You went to college, graduated, got a job, and it&rsquo;s not what you wanted, hoped for, or whatever. Or maybe you&rsquo;ve been in the same job for years, and it&rsquo;s just no fun anymore. And you look at your friends who are hackers. Yeah, we&rsquo;re anti-social, maybe kinda jerks, but we have <em>so much fun</em> at work, and get pretty well compensated for <em>playing.</em></p>

<p>And maybe you think, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back to school and get a second B.S. in Computer Science!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chill out.</p>

<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re just guessing this whole software thing is for you and you can&rsquo;t wait to get started!</p>

<p>Chill out.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to encourage you, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. But I&rsquo;m also going to encourage you to be realistic. Because I want you to be successful, not just to sprint down a blind alley. We&rsquo;ll get through this, together.</p>

<h3>Lower your expectations</h3>

<p>Look, it&rsquo;s not all rainbows, lollipops and gumdrops. It&rsquo;s not. For me, coding is a pleasure and a privilege, but it&rsquo;s not for everyone. There are <em>extremely shitty jobs</em> out there, doing what I do, and just because I&rsquo;m on cloud nine, doesn&rsquo;t mean you will be.</p>

<p>Furthermore, even though it&rsquo;s a demand-side market (there are far more job openings than talented developers), the really great jobs are still competitive as hell.</p>

<h3>Still here?</h3>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t dissuaded you? Good. Good, young padawan.</p>

<p>Since (for the couple of people toward whom this post is targeted directly) I haven taken it upon myself to train you as your Jedi master, I&rsquo;m going to point you toward <a href="http://ruby-lang.org" title="Ruby">Ruby</a> as your first language. It&rsquo;s not a perfect language, but it is beautiful, and presents a useful paradigm (object-oriented programming) in the purest form possible. So let&rsquo;s start with some Ruby resources.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s your pre-frosh curriculum:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://tryruby.org" title="Try Ruby">Try Ruby</a> &ndash; Learn the basics, in your browser!</li>
<li><a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/" title="Learn Ruby The Hard Way">Learn Ruby The Hard Way</a> &ndash; Zed Shaw is (maybe) a jerk, but his books are good. This is a good (free) place to start.</li>
<li><a href="http://rubykoans.com/" title="Ruby Koans">Ruby Koans</a> &ndash; Once you&rsquo;ve got a little under your belt, <a href="http://rubykoans.com/" title="Ruby Koans">Ruby Koans</a> is your next step to make sure you&rsquo;ve got the basics under your belt.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Really? <em>Still</em> Interested?</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s fuckin' awesome. I&rsquo;m really happy you&rsquo;re still into this.</p>

<p>Now I get to knock you on your ass, grasshopper. Hopefully you&rsquo;ve read my blog (or know me) enough to know how I feel about learning to build &ldquo;apps&rdquo; without a firm grounding in the fundamentals of computer science. So we&rsquo;re going address this right the hell now.</p>

<p>See, you didn&rsquo;t major in Computer Science. That&rsquo;s okay, niether did I. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you get a pass on it. We&rsquo;re going to look at some resources to get you the grounding you need to really get up to snuff on the shit you&rsquo;d better know if you want to be a Real Programmerâ„¢.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get started.</p>

<p>The first thing you need is math. I&rsquo;m not talking your standard college Calculus or Algebra stuff, but the Real Math you need as a real programmer. So here&rsquo;s the deal: read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics" title="Concrete Mathematics">Concrete Mathematics</a>.</p>

<p><img class="[float-right] <a" src="href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518GBVWEBYL.jpg">http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518GBVWEBYL.jpg</a>" title="Concrete Mathematics" ></p>

<p>This book, let me tell you, it was co-written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth" title="Donald Knuth">Knuth</a>, because, let me tell you, Knuth weighed all the extant math texts in the balance and found them lacking. And if Knuth finds you lacking&hellip; jsut go home. This book tricks you into learning both algorithmic estimation and recursion in chapter one and never looks back. It is indispensible.</p>

<p>Next, you need to grok a few things: computability theory, Turing machines, syntax and semantics, etc. Once upon a time, I would have shoved a copy of <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/" title="SICP">The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> in your face so fast, it would have made your head spin.</p>

<p><img class="[float-right] <a" src="href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/SICP_cover.jpg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/SICP_cover.jpg</a>" title="SICP" ></p>

<p>But, young padawan, I&rsquo;ve decided to ease you into your Jedi training, and we&rsquo;ve settled on Ruby as your focus of practice before you graduate to the full Lisp light saber, so let&rsquo;s consider an alternative.</p>

<p><a href="http://oreilly.com/" title="O'Reilly">O'reilly</a> recently published an excellent intro to CS book called <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025481.do" title="Understanding Computation">Understanding Computation</a>, which covers about half the material in SICP, but in Ruby, and probably more acessibly than SICP (aka The Wizard Book), especially since you (by now) have a passing familiarity with Ruby.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s see&hellip; we&rsquo;ve got you started on Ruby, given you some good resources on the basics of CS, and you&rsquo;re on your way&hellip; what next?</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<p>Now we get into the areas where you&rsquo;re exploring on your own, and just coming back to me for help and guidance. Congratualtions! You&rsquo;re nearly ready to graduate to a full Jedi.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s available.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codeschool.com/" title="Code School">Code School</a> is really great, and completely worth the US$25 a month they charge for their entire course catalog.</li>
<li><a href="http://coursera.com/" title="Coursera">Coursera</a> has great CS classes, not typically Ruby based, but you&rsquo;ll learn some core concepts that will be extensively useful.</li>
<li><a href="http://codecademy.com/" title="Codecademy">Codecademy</a> has free courses, of varying quality.</li>
<li><a href="http://betamore.com/academy/" title="Betamore Academy">Betamore Academy</a> has 10-week courses here in Baltimore that will bootstrap you pretty well as a developer, as well as providing networking opportunities to find internships and jobs.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ll try to update this in the future. And you know you can always get in touch and I&rsquo;m more than happy to give you a hand. There&rsquo;s nothin more exciting to me than smart folks falling in love with coding. Happy trails, bro, and remember to keep it fun.</p>
