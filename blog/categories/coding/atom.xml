    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is a follow up to a previous entry, <a href="/blog/2013/09/29/letter-to-a-young-or-new-programmer/">&ldquo;Letter to a Young (Or New) Programmer&rdquo;</a>.</em></p>

<p>So you&rsquo;ve been working through some of those excellent online resources, like <a href="http://learncodethehardway.org/">Learn Code The Hard Way</a>, or <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a>, or whatever. You think you can build something now, and you want to get out there in the world and hack things better, but there&rsquo;s this one little problem&hellip; you have a degree in Philosophy or Psychology or no degree at all, and no résumé-worthy coding experience.</p>

<h4>Not. A. Problem.</h4>

<p>Well, not necessarily a problem. There&rsquo;s an easy solution. Just. Get. Hacking.</p>

<p>So you don&rsquo;t know about XP, Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall&hellip; there&rsquo;s always <a href="http://programming-motherfucker.com/">Programming, Motherfucker</a>.</p>

<p>So you haven&rsquo;t built an Enterprise Expert System with the AbstractVisitorFactoryAntiPatternCringeGenerator pattern&hellip; I told you to make an account on <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>, didn&rsquo;t I? And I know you take my advice because you&rsquo;re building actual goddamn software.</p>

<p>Put your stuff on Github. Ask for help on IRC.</p>

<p>Find projects that interest you, fork &lsquo;em, submit pull requests. Lots of projects even have issues labeled as &ldquo;suitable for n00bs&rdquo;.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h4>The Enterprise Dilemma</h4>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>Any shop worth working at cares so much more about your coding chops, your potential, your intelligence than bullshit like résumés and academic credentials that if you can demonstrate your ability and still don&rsquo;t get the job, it&rsquo;s a blessing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you <em>do</em> need a first coding job. And if you&rsquo;re not getting it based on your Github activity, you&rsquo;re probably getting it based on nepotism.</p>

<p>How does this happen? Still goes back to Github, IRC, meetups, etc. So go to some meetups. Talk to people, go to the pub nights, go to the open hack nights. Hack on open source projects, submit pull requests, get in on some projects that will get you recognized. Eventually, you&rsquo;ll have hacker friends who will hire you or recommend you to take over their shitty Enterprise jobs that you can use to build your résumé should you go down that route. It&rsquo;s not that hard. Hang out with nerds, learn the craft, make connections. Programming is one of the few fields where it really is <em>what you know,</em> but who you know can help too. But those connections are best made by being a badass hacker.</p>

<h4>Open Source is the Key</h4>

<p>At the end of the day, though, even if you do all sorts of networking at confs and meetups and the like, you need a strong presence in the Open Source community. I can&rsquo;t emphasize this enough: <strong>PUT YOUR CODE ON GITHUB.</strong></p>

<p>Or Bitbucket or whatever if you prefer, but open source that shit, get other people involved, and get involved in other people&rsquo;s projects.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in the position of having to evaluate and hire developers at <a href="http://anestuary.com">An Estuary</a>, and since I want to run the dev shop I wish existed, I&rsquo;m trying to hire that way. When we list positions, we require a Github URL because I want to see what you do, not what your former employers think of you. I assume they&rsquo;re &ldquo;former&rdquo; (or soon-to-be &ldquo;former&rdquo;) for good reason. When we interview you, I want to talk about your code, not your former supervisor&rsquo;s probable inferiority complex.</p>

<p>In summary, just get hacking. Just keep hacking. Build cool shit. Show it to the world. Talk to other nerds. Maybe try some remote pairing (Tweeting with the hashtag #pairwithme is often productive). But just make stuff. Then show me what you can do when you want a job. If you start off with a great company, that should be all you need.</p>

    <id>http://decomplecting.org/blog/2013/09/29/letter-to-a-young-or-new-programmer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I get it. You went to college, graduated, got a job, and it&rsquo;s not what you wanted, hoped for, or whatever. Or maybe you&rsquo;ve been in the same job for years, and it&rsquo;s just no fun anymore. And you look at your friends who are hackers. Yeah, we&rsquo;re anti-social, maybe kinda jerks, but we have <em>so much fun</em> at work, and get pretty well compensated for <em>playing.</em></p>

<p>And maybe you think, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back to school and get a second B.S. in Computer Science!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chill out.</p>

<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re just guessing this whole software thing is for you and you can&rsquo;t wait to get started!</p>

<p>Chill out.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to encourage you, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. But I&rsquo;m also going to encourage you to be realistic. Because I want you to be successful, not just to sprint down a blind alley. We&rsquo;ll get through this, together.</p>

<h3>Lower your expectations</h3>

<p>Look, it&rsquo;s not all rainbows, lollipops and gumdrops. It&rsquo;s not. For me, coding is a pleasure and a privilege, but it&rsquo;s not for everyone. There are <em>extremely shitty jobs</em> out there, doing what I do, and just because I&rsquo;m on cloud nine, doesn&rsquo;t mean you will be.</p>

<p>Furthermore, even though it&rsquo;s a demand-side market (there are far more job openings than talented developers), the really great jobs are still competitive as hell.</p>

<h3>Still here?</h3>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t dissuaded you? Good. Good, young padawan.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Since (for the couple of people toward whom this post is targeted directly) I haven taken it upon myself to train you as your Jedi master, I&rsquo;m going to point you toward <a href="http://ruby-lang.org" title="Ruby">Ruby</a> as your first language. It&rsquo;s not a perfect language, but it is beautiful, and presents a useful paradigm (object-oriented programming) in the purest form possible. So let&rsquo;s start with some Ruby resources.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s your pre-frosh curriculum:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://tryruby.org" title="Try Ruby">Try Ruby</a> &ndash; Learn the basics, in your browser!</li>
<li><a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/" title="Learn Ruby The Hard Way">Learn Ruby The Hard Way</a> &ndash; Zed Shaw is (maybe) a jerk, but his books are good. This is a good (free) place to start.</li>
<li><a href="http://rubykoans.com/" title="Ruby Koans">Ruby Koans</a> &ndash; Once you&rsquo;ve got a little under your belt, <a href="http://rubykoans.com/" title="Ruby Koans">Ruby Koans</a> is your next step to make sure you&rsquo;ve got the basics under your belt.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Really? <em>Still</em> Interested?</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s fuckin' awesome. I&rsquo;m really happy you&rsquo;re still into this.</p>

<p>Now I get to knock you on your ass, grasshopper. Hopefully you&rsquo;ve read my blog (or know me) enough to know how I feel about learning to build &ldquo;apps&rdquo; without a firm grounding in the fundamentals of computer science. So we&rsquo;re going address this right the hell now.</p>

<p>See, you didn&rsquo;t major in Computer Science. That&rsquo;s okay, niether did I. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you get a pass on it. We&rsquo;re going to look at some resources to get you the grounding you need to really get up to snuff on the shit you&rsquo;d better know if you want to be a Real Programmer™.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get started.</p>

<p>The first thing you need is math. I&rsquo;m not talking your standard college Calculus or Algebra stuff, but the Real Math you need as a real programmer. So here&rsquo;s the deal: read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics" title="Concrete Mathematics">Concrete Mathematics</a>.</p>

<p><img class="[float-right] <a" src="href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518GBVWEBYL.jpg">http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518GBVWEBYL.jpg</a>" title="Concrete Mathematics" ></p>

<p>This book, let me tell you, it was co-written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth" title="Donald Knuth">Knuth</a>, because, let me tell you, Knuth weighed all the extant math texts in the balance and found them lacking. And if Knuth finds you lacking&hellip; jsut go home. This book tricks you into learning both algorithmic estimation and recursion in chapter one and never looks back. It is indispensible.</p>

<p>Next, you need to grok a few things: computability theory, Turing machines, syntax and semantics, etc. Once upon a time, I would have shoved a copy of <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/" title="SICP">The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> in your face so fast, it would have made your head spin.</p>

<p><img class="[float-right] <a" src="href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/SICP_cover.jpg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/SICP_cover.jpg</a>" title="SICP" ></p>

<p>But, young padawan, I&rsquo;ve decided to ease you into your Jedi training, and we&rsquo;ve settled on Ruby as your focus of practice before you graduate to the full Lisp light saber, so let&rsquo;s consider an alternative.</p>

<p><a href="http://oreilly.com/" title="O'Reilly">O'reilly</a> recently published an excellent intro to CS book called <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025481.do" title="Understanding Computation">Understanding Computation</a>, which covers about half the material in SICP, but in Ruby, and probably more acessibly than SICP (aka The Wizard Book), especially since you (by now) have a passing familiarity with Ruby.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s see&hellip; we&rsquo;ve got you started on Ruby, given you some good resources on the basics of CS, and you&rsquo;re on your way&hellip; what next?</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<p>Now we get into the areas where you&rsquo;re exploring on your own, and just coming back to me for help and guidance. Congratualtions! You&rsquo;re nearly ready to graduate to a full Jedi.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s available.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codeschool.com/" title="Code School">Code School</a> is really great, and completely worth the US$25 a month they charge for their entire course catalog.</li>
<li><a href="http://coursera.com/" title="Coursera">Coursera</a> has great CS classes, not typically Ruby based, but you&rsquo;ll learn some core concepts that will be extensively useful.</li>
<li><a href="http://codecademy.com/" title="Codecademy">Codecademy</a> has free courses, of varying quality.</li>
<li><a href="http://betamore.com/academy/" title="Betamore Academy">Betamore Academy</a> has 10-week courses here in Baltimore that will bootstrap you pretty well as a developer, as well as providing networking opportunities to find internships and jobs.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ll try to update this in the future. And you know you can always get in touch and I&rsquo;m more than happy to give you a hand. There&rsquo;s nothin more exciting to me than smart folks falling in love with coding. Happy trails, bro, and remember to keep it fun.</p>

    <id>http://decomplecting.org/blog/2013/06/02/were-not-ready-to-teach-kids-to-code</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Think Kids Should Learn To Code? Teach The Teachers First</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m really excited about the heavy emphasis I&rsquo;m seeing on <a href="http://gettingsmart.com/2013/05/teaching-kids-to-code-an-economic-social-justice-issue/">teaching kids to code</a>. Although I agree with just about everything <a href="http://codinghorror.com">Jeff Atwood</a> wrote in his controversial post, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html">&ldquo;Please Don&rsquo;t Learn to Code&rdquo;</a>, I also believe that in an age in which <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html">software is eating the world</a>, understanding code is a basic literacy issue. This goes beyond the concept of digital literacy: as applied, this boils down to knowing how to use Google. What we&rsquo;re seeing in the movement to bring coding into the core curriculum is a new emphasis on what I&rsquo;d like to call <em>computational literacy.</em></p>

<h3>Computational Literacy</h3>

<p>Computational literacy is a concept that I wish had been &ldquo;a thing&rdquo; when I was in school. I&rsquo;ll start with an anecdote, and then delve into the gritty challenges that the &ldquo;teaching kids to code&rdquo; movement is failing to recognize.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, I loved math&hellip; or, at least, I loved figuring out the algorithms behind the calculation. I learned BASIC when I was 5 or 6, so when got to middle school, and discovered that the Texas Instruments graphing calculators we were required to buy for class spoke just about the same dialect of BASIC I had learned as a kid (I first learned to code on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A">TI 99/4A</a>), I was so excited. Once I could derive the algorithm from a new concept we were being taught, I could express it in code and skip the boring parts. I&rsquo;ve never done well when bored.</p>

<p>Alas, my youthful optimism was to be dashed on the rocks of pedagogical ignorance and stupidity. First, I was told that I wouldn&rsquo;t receive credit for my <strong>correct</strong> answers because I didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;show my work&rdquo;.</p>

<p>On the next exam, I wrote out the source listing of each program I had used with a reference to the problems to which it had been applied (I&rsquo;m pretty sure the number of GOTOs I used in those days would have made Dijkstra cry).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when they usually called my mom in for a conference.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>WTF Technophobes</h3>

<p>I have to give my mother credit here. We went into those meetings facing an irate math teacher discussing how I was being insolent and writing a program instead of learning the math concepts I was supposed to learn in the class. My mother&rsquo;s response was a deadpan &ldquo;If he didn&rsquo;t understand the concepts, how could he write the program?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did I mention my mom is awesome?</p>

<p>There was never a real resolution to this. I stopped taking math when I&rsquo;d gotten enough credits to graduate (thanks, all my math teachers, for teaching me to hate a subject I once loved because it was taught by ignorant technophobes). I tried again in college, but was greeted by the same attitude, so combined with that and a required CS 101 class on Visual Basic (as if I would even run Windows, much less write VB), I majored in Philosophy. Okay, that&rsquo;s enough spleen for this post (and I have no regrets majoring in Philosophy; you&rsquo;ll learn more critical thinking skills in a good philosophy program than in any Applied Math or CS program).</p>

<h3>Teaching Kids to Code? Why?</h3>

<p>We need a paradigm shift in education before we even <em>dream</em> of making coding part of the curriculum. Until we challenge our basic attitudes and assumptions, teaching kids to code in school will be an abject failure, for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>The first is that abstract learning without application is meaningless. I&rsquo;m not the most emotive viewer, but Conrad Wolfram did a TED talk a while back that had me jumping out of my chair, clapping, and shouting &ldquo;#{expletives.sample} yeah!&rdquo; repeatedly at my computer. Here&rsquo;s the video (If you haven&rsquo;t watched &ldquo;Teaching kids real math with computers&rdquo;, do so NOW):</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/60OVlfAUPJg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>If our math curricula (the subject best suited to a programming solution!) are based around chidren doing rote, repetitive calculation, what&rsquo;s the point in teaching them to code? I had hoped that maybe the attitude toward programming in schools had changed in the nearly 15 years since I graduated high school, but a quick Google search showed that not much has changed, e.g. <a href="http://www.k12.wa.us/mathematics/CalculatorPolicy.aspx">Washington&rsquo;s state K-12 math calculator policy</a>.</p>

<p>No programs. No code, dogs, or Irish need apply.</p>

<p>How can we even <em>think</em> of teaching kids to code while code is a &ldquo;cheat,&rdquo; &ldquo;not showing your work&rdquo; (where&rsquo;s the harm in automating work that <em>should</em> be considered beneath human dignity?), et cetera.</p>

<p>Most of the proposals I&rsquo;ve seen around the &ldquo;teaching kids to code&rdquo; thing center on getting practicing software engineeers to volunteer their time with kids to teach them basic (and more advanced, if they&rsquo;re into it) programming skills.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re totally into this idea! Particularly in the Ruby community, there&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.kidsruby.com/">KidsRuby</a> and <a href="http://hackety.com/">Hackety Hack!</a>, awesome projects centered around teaching kids basic programming skills in a fun and easy-to-learn dynamic language.</p>

<p>But until teachers understand the tech enough to embrace (rather than fear) it, what&rsquo;s the point?</p>

<p>If I wasn&rsquo;t already at least a hobbyist hacker, and I was taking my first programming course, and arrived in math class only to be told I couldn&rsquo;t apply my exciting and newly-learned skills to the problem at hand, because it was like cheating, how would I react? I&rsquo;d most likely lose interest in a subject I couldn&rsquo;t apply to anything.</p>

<p>Okay, well, <em>I</em> would likely lose interest in my math class (or at least my math teacher) because code is <em>so frakking cool.</em> But I&rsquo;m trying to imagine myself as the student who isn&rsquo;t a huge nerd.</p>

<h3>Quis docet ipsos doctores?</h3>

<p>It might sound like I&rsquo;ve been a bit harsh toward the teachers here. Nothing could be further from my intent. As I&rsquo;ve gained time and distance, I&rsquo;ve realized that it&rsquo;s merely ignorance that built a wall between us; not stupidity, and certainly not malice. And it was an ignorance for which they were not responsible; it was the fault of the system that trained them, and the system that was later responsible for their professional development.</p>

<p>No one ever taught my teachers about software; what went into building it, using it, etc.</p>

<p>If (most of) the teachers are computational illiterates, how can we expect the kids to become computationally literate in any meaningful way?</p>

<p>Technology has penetrated pedagogy to a significant degree but hasn&rsquo;t really changed the practice in a fundamental way; if your use of technology isn&rsquo;t transformative, it&rsquo;s a misuse, possibly an abuse.</p>

<p>Where technology hasn&rsquo;t penetrated in a meaningful way is in professional development. Teachers are still &ldquo;improving&rdquo; their skills in more or less the same way they were decades ago. This has to change. If you&rsquo;re teaching in a STEM-related area and you cannot or will not understand variable assignment, iteration, recursion, and other basic concepts &mdash; the very basics of coding &mdash; you should find a new career. I&rsquo;m not saying you need to delve into pointers, concurrency, etc. Just the basics. If I were going into high school all over again (and this is what I intend for my daughter (if she&rsquo;s into it), so Math Teachers Beware!), I would go in with a mastery of <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a>, and a willingness to get myself expelled for refusing to do rote calculation when I could solve the problem with a 3-line recursive function in Scheme.</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s The Answer?</h3>

<p>Good question. I think the reason we don&rsquo;t have a good answer yet is that we&rsquo;ve been asking the wrong question. Getting developers to mentor students is a fantastic idea; if my time wasn&rsquo;t 120% consumed between a startup and a six month old, I&rsquo;d be spending my free time (that&rsquo;s a thing?) volunteering to teach kids to program. But we run into a roadblock when the general population of educators need a class just to use Twitter. Which is why I ask, &ldquo;Quis docet ipsos doctores?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Who teaches the teachers themselves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is also why I&rsquo;m so excited about working at <a href="http://anestuary.com">An Estuary</a>. The opportunity to bring technological solutions not just to education, but to professional development within education, is the opportunity to bridge the gap between what students need to learn and what teachers are capable of allowing them to learn in a meaningful way. Of bringing education into the 21st century (after dragging it kicking and screaming through the 20th, because it&rsquo;s currently stuck in the 19th, albeit with some toys from the future).</p>

<p>I never want another child to look at her teacher and think (as I did) &ldquo;are you from the past?&rdquo; I never want another nerd to hate math because his teacher didn&rsquo;t understand that <em>the code is the work.</em> I never want another hacker to give up on education because her teachers, professors, peers, etc. appeared to be stupid or malicious when they were merely ignorant.</p>

<p>I want to change the system. I want to make &ldquo;it gets better&rdquo; real for hackers and nerds.</p>

<p>I want to make the subjugation of billions of children to the subhuman task of rote calculation a thing of the past.</p>

<p>How far am I willing to go?</p>

<p>Doctores docebo, si necesse est.</p>

<p>We must teach the teachers, or teaching the children is so much tilting at windmills. There are no easy solutions, but I&rsquo;m proud to be part of a company that&rsquo;s addressing the hard problems.</p>

<h3>Postscript</h3>

<p>This post has been long in the making; shortly after I completed the first draft, <a href="https://www.edsurge.com">EdSurge</a> posted an opinion piece, <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-05-28-opinion-learning-to-code-isn-t-enough">&ldquo;Learning To Code Isn&rsquo;t Enough&rdquo;</a>, which looked at this issue a little differently. It cited a wonderful article on <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wing/www/publications/Wing06.pdf">&ldquo;Computational Thinking&rdquo;</a> (essentially what I describe as &ldquo;computational literacy&rdquo;) by Jeanette Wing, arguing for the equal status of CS fundamentals with reading, writing, and arithmetic in curriculum standards.</p>

<p>The article also highlights a problem with the &ldquo;teach kids to code&rdquo; movement, which I see as complementary to my own objections; while I was arguing that it&rsquo;s pointless to teach kids to code when they won&rsquo;t be <em>allowed</em> to apply that skill, the EdSurge piece points out the absurdity of teaching kids to code without giving concrete opportunities to apply the ability.</p>

<p>Essentially, it comes down to the same thing: coding is wonderful, but if it&rsquo;s not applied to a real-world problem, it&rsquo;s a waste of resources.</p>

<p>I learned BASIC so I could make my screen draw pictures. That&rsquo;s great for a five year old. But I learned C so I could make my printer work with Linux; I learned Perl so I could type fewer commands into the shell; I learned PHP and SQL to build websites, and I learned Ruby because PHP sucks. I learned Scheme because I wanted to hack my way through SICP, and I learned Clojure because I wanted to do concurrent programming without mutexes. There was always a reason, a purpose, an application.</p>

<p>If we want kids to code, we must not only allow them to apply that knowledge whenever and wherever the opportunity arises, we must also train teachers to always and everywhere encourage the application of computational thinking (as well as programming) to whatever problem set presents itself as a viable candidate.</p>

<p>A while ago, I <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2012/08/03/legacy-systems-on-rails-part-2/">wrote a post about Bubba</a> (not its real name), a legacy/vendor-supplied system in which the original developers (may they suffer eternal torment) decided to store all datetimes as floating-point values using a bastardized form of the Julian Day system with fractional day part. In that post, I showed a solution used in a Ruby on Rails web app, but now I&rsquo;m writing data integration services for multiple systems, and needed something a bit more robust, so I&rsquo;m writing it in Clojure.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/clj-time">clj-time</a> library by Sean Corfield. It&rsquo;s basically a wrapper around the <a href="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/">Joda Time</a> Java library, allowing us to use its powerful datetime handling in idiomatic Clojure.</p>

<p>So, for the actual code. First, the Bubba dates need to be converted to and from a floating point value to a normal Date object.</p>

<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s probably a lot to take in, but basically it performs the calculations to convert the floating-point dates to Date objects and back again. But there&rsquo;s still a catch. In some of the views I&rsquo;ve built for reporting, I&rsquo;m pre-converting those dates to Oracle SQL TIMESTAMP types, and depending on the context, sometimes those floats come back as Doubles, and sometimes as BigDecimals.</p>

<p>Clojure&rsquo;s got me covered, with multimethods.</p>

<p> Much like generics in Common Lisp (well, CLOS anyhow) <code>defmulti</code> takes a dispatch function as an argument, in this case <code>class</code>, which returns the class of the argument passed to the multimethod. Methods can then be defined to handle each type of possile argument, with a <code>:default</code> method for unmatched cases. Multimethods can be used with any dispatch function you like, but <code>class</code> is a common use case, and handy as hell here.</p>

<p> As I mentioned, the point of this is to get data in and out of multiple systems, and they all have their own idiosyncracies.</p>

<p> For instance, there&rsquo;s, uhh, let&rsquo;s call it Joe&rsquo;s Directory, or JD, which stores all of its dates and datetimes as strings, with inconsistant formatting across the board.</p>

<p> Luckily, clj-time has awesome parsers:</p>

<p>Easy as pie. Where it gets truly beautiful, however, is when mixed in with <a href="http://sqlkorma.com/">Korma</a> for SQL abstraction. Korma entities have two special macros for data conversion: <code>prepare</code>, which applies a function to data before storing it in the database, and <code>transform</code> which applies a function when reading from the database.</p>

<p>Since Korma returns query results as a vector of hashmaps, it&rsquo;s as simple as updating a hashmap:</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the first version of the transform fn I wrote for JD, but there&rsquo;s two problems. First, the fields to apply are hard-coded in the <code>let</code> form. More importantly, however, is the condition where I do a <code>select</code> and don&rsquo;t return those fields; <code>update-in</code> will add the field with a value of <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>So we need a higher-order function, and a bit of help from <code>clojure.set</code></p>

<p>Finding the set intersection of the fields we normally want to transform, and the fields returned, ensures we don&rsquo;t get extra fields with values of <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>And look, I resisted the temptation to use a macro where a function would suffice! Do I get points for good Lisp behavior?</p>

<p>Then it&rsquo;s as simple of using a lambda that applies this function inside our korma entity declaration:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>So that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m normalizing datetimes in this particular project. I&rsquo;m really enjoying writing code like this: building short, composable functions and refactoring by decomplecting them into shorter, more composable functions.</p>

<p>I find refactoring easier to reason about in Clojure than any other language I&rsquo;ve worked in. Thinking in terms of simple, composable functions (particularly having the facility of higher-order functions and macros) also makes it very straightforward to decouple interface and implementation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll state for the record I&rsquo;m fairly new to Clojure, so it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if this code looks pretty amateurish to more experienced Clojurians. If anyone has any suggestions for improving it, I&rsquo;d welcome the advice.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sadly, I haven&rsquo;t added a blog post in roughly 2.5 months. I&rsquo;ve had ideas for posts, but when it came time to set pen to page (or fingers to keyboard, as teh case may be) I just haven&rsquo;t had it in me. I really enjoy writing this blog, too. I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what was going on, until I read one of the most insightful blog posts I&rsquo;ve ever seen: <a href="http://edu.mkrecny.com/thoughts/be-nice-to-programmers">Be Nice To Programmers</a>.</p>

<p>The tl;dr is a dialogue between a programmer and a guy who wishes he had the chops because he thinks coding is the neatest job in the world. The programmer tells him he thinks coding is making him miserable because the the development/debug process is the ultimate negative feedback loop.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>My workflow is something like this.</p></p><p><p>write some code<br/>run the code<br/>get an error message<br/>find the error and back to step 1<br/>Hour by hour, day after day, I do this. Always searching for what&rsquo;s wrong with what I&rsquo;m creating, rarely thinking about what&rsquo;s good about it. It&rsquo;s a negative reinforcement feedback loop.</p><footer><strong>[<a href="http://edu.mkrecny.com/thoughts/be-nice-to-programmers">http://edu.mkrecny.com/thoughts/be-nice-to-programmers</a>]</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>My last post was just before a huge project I&rsquo;d both originated and put a large amount of my time and effort into over the course of 15-18 months was shelved. It was ready to ship, but corporate politics being what it is (i.e., something I&rsquo;d schedule a root canal to avoid, <em>especially</em> where I work), I tried to just move on and not lose sleep over it. Still, it rankled.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t pushed a single new commit to any of my projects on Github. I haven&rsquo;t written a blog post. I have an engineering pad with a bunch of scribbled, inchoate notes for things I want to do, but can&rsquo;t seem to move on anything.</p>

<p>My own theory is that we (hackers) are especially sensitive to feedback loops. I could go <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2012/05/22/passion/">on and on</a>, and even cite <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/07/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats.html">more</a> <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/wontprogram.htm">notable</a> <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/02/the-nonprogramming-programmer.html">bloggers</a> than myself, on my theory of what could be referred to as &ldquo;programmer exceptionalism.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not to say we (programmers who can actually build working (and hopefully, elegant) systems) are in any way <em>better</em> than non-programmers (or the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html">Java Schools</a> crowd); it&rsquo;s just that the preponderance of anecdotal evidence (not to mention some <a href="http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf">proper research</a>) suggests that <em>programmers are not normal.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sensitivity to feedback loops&rdquo; could also be a symptom of the intuition many of us experience when faced with an implementation that just <em>feels</em> wrong. We can, through due diligence, prove that this is the case eventually; but what is it that drives us to find exploits, or benchmark competing implementations? It&rsquo;s that little voice in the back of your head whispering, &ldquo;This is wrong. And also, stupid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My main focus in my day-to-day programming life right now is dealing with interfaces for yet another vendor product that is very wrong, and very, very stupid. So when I come home, I just want to play <a href="http://guildwars2.com">Guild Wars 2</a> and not really think about coding. Which makes me even sadder, because I love hacking on side projects.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s not that I haven&rsquo;t had some fun and some successes in the meantime. I wrote a pretty cool framework in Clojure for generating and emailing reports from various datasources. The core of it is going to be open source, as soon as I get around to that. But the grind&hellip; the grind, man. The grind.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the solution is. We can&rsquo;t all be working on innovative, game-changing products all the time. And sometimes things will get shelved the day you expect them to ship. I do know there needs to be a way to <em>love</em> this shit without going crazy or making oneself miserable.</p>

<p>So, interwebs&hellip; suggestions?</p>
