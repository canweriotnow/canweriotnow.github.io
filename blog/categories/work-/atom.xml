    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been a while since my last post, because the last few weeks have been just a little crazy.</p>

<p>I've left <a href="http://www.jhu.edu">JHU</a>, and accepted the role of Chief Technology Officer at <a href="http://anestuary.com">An Estuary</a>, an amazing EdTech startup spun out from Baltimore's <a href="http://www.digitalharborfoundation.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>It's kinda crazy going from a massive institution with about 40k employees, to a startup. But we're building amazing things, iterating like crazy, and having an unbelievable amountof fun doing it.</p>

<p>So stay on the lookout for An Estuary... the sky's the limit, folks. I'd forgotten what it was like to wake up in the morning and being excited to get to work. Now I remember. It's an amazing feel, and this is an amazing time. And I work with the <a href="http://anestuary.weebly.com/1/post/2013/05/a-great-team.html">best people I could hope to work with.</a></p>

<p>Life is good.</p>
