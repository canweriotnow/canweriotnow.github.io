    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve always taken a hands-off approach to moderating comments, feeling that it was a form of censorship to restrict discussion even on my own blog. It&rsquo;s worked pretty well; I feel like prior to yesterday, I&rsquo;ve deleted less than three comments in the three years I&rsquo;ve maintained this blog.</p>

<p>But yesterday&rsquo;s post, <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2014/06/09/im-telling/">I&rsquo;m Telling :: Employer-Tattling and The Decline of Agency</a>, brought in some of the nastiest of trolls, and I had to re-evaluate that policy. The post also got so many comments I was going crazy trying to weigh my anti-censorship views against comments that bordered on hate speech.</p>

<p>I even asked Twitter for advice:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Twitter, I need advice about when it&#39;s appropriate to moderate blog comments. Becoming uncomfortable with my hands-off policy, sadly.</p>&mdash; &#39;(jason lewis) (@canweriotnow) <a href="https://twitter.com/canweriotnow/statuses/476164584227602432">June 10, 2014</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I got a number of suggestions:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/canweriotnow">@canweriotnow</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ckaratnytsky">@ckaratnytsky</a> If it is libellous, slanderous, threatening, or grossly offensive, then have at it.</p>&mdash; Khaled Z (@der_bluthund) <a href="https://twitter.com/der_bluthund/statuses/476165033773514752">June 10, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I want to disable comments completely. But as <a href="https://twitter.com/lastwheel">@lastwheel</a> suggests, there are plenty of other places for people to converse. In fact, the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7869644">Hacker News thread</a> for the post mentioned above had some pretty great (as well as pretty terrible, but hey, it&rsquo;s HN) replies. Plenty of blogs I read even post links to HN and Reddit threads in lieu of on-site comments.</p>

<h3>The plan</h3>

<p>So here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do, as an experiment. Comments will remain open for 24-48 hours on the post. After that, I&rsquo;m closing the thread, and you can take it to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>, or wherever else the post ends up. Ths way there&rsquo;s ample time for discussion, but I don&rsquo;t have to worry about spending my life moderating comments. Hell, I rarely have time for blogging in the first place lately.</p>

<p>If you have any other suggestions&hellip; Look, comments!</p>
