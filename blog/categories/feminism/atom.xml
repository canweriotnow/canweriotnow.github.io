    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other night Twitter was abuzz with controversy and drama, as per usual. One of those threads (which I&rsquo;ll get to momentarily) invovled what I&rsquo;ll refer to as &ldquo;employer-tattling,&rdquo; and <a href="https://twitter.com/soederpop">Jon Soeder</a> (laudably without drawing attention to the ongoing echo chamber), tweeted this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet center" lang="en"><p>If somebody says something vile on the internet, it is not your place to notify their employer. You are setting a terrible precedent.</p>&mdash; your boy jon soeder (@soederpop) <a href="https://twitter.com/soederpop/statuses/475127514655100929">June 7, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t mention which Twitter thread prompted this, but I have an educated guess.</p>

<h3>Last Friday Night</h3>

<p>Someone called <a href="https://twitter.com/shanley">Shanley Kane</a> a cunt. Okay, it was <a href="https://twitter.com/zivcjs">Ash Taylor</a>, lest I be accused of omitting details. Apparently, he quickly thought better of it and deleted the tweet, but Shanley got a screenshot!</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet center" lang="en"><p>so <a href="https://twitter.com/zivcjs">@zivcjs</a>, who works for <a href="https://twitter.com/Livestream">@livestream</a> under <a href="https://twitter.com/maxhaot">@maxhaot</a>, deleted his tweets calling me a cunt but screenshots <a href="https://t.co/UfLYcuhoFs">pic.twitter.com/UfLYcuhoFs</a></p>&mdash; Shanley (@shanley) <a href="https://twitter.com/shanley/statuses/475066367956103168">June 7, 2014</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>Using that kind of language (in general, but particularly in a public, online forum such as Twitter) is offensive, inexcusable, and basically stupid. My guess is that Ash realized this when he deleted the tweet.</p>

<p>Ash also <a href="http://zi.vc/apology.html">apologized publicly</a> to Shanley and <a href="https://twitter.com/ashedryden">Ashe Dryden</a> (also mentioned in the offending tweet), even after <a href="https://twitter.com/livestream">Livestream</a> fired him.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been pointed out in the related <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7865425">Hacker News thread</a> that Shanley herself is not known for shying away from <a href="https://medium.com/about-work/finding-out-youre-a-sexist-misogynistic-homophobic-classist-racist-asshole-and-hypocrite-f986fbd5e51f">name-calling</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ryan/status/474791621100199936">ad hominem</a> attacks.</p>

<p>But the point of this post isn&rsquo;t whether unproductive and childish name-calling (sexist or not) should be acceptable in public discourse; it&rsquo;s about employer-tattling, and its rather disturbing implications.</p>

<h3>Playground Rules</h3>

<p>My first concern about employer-tattling is the infantilizing effect it has both on the offended party, and on public discourse in general. This decline of agency implies a troubling transfer of responsibility from individuals to institutions. One would hope that adults functioning in the public sphere would have the maturity both to own their words (and mistakes), and appropriately respond to criticism — and difficult though it may be, sometimes ignoring trolls is the most productive response.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png">http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png</a>" title="Duty Calls" ></p>

<p>Increasingly, we&rsquo;re seeing a tendency to run to the nearest &ldquo;adult&rdquo; to plead for them to punish the offending party. And in a world of adults behaving like spoiled children, the next relative equivalent to an adult (i.e., position of power or authority) is either the State or, if no laws have been broken, a corporation.</p>

<h3>Corporations aren&rsquo;t just people, they&rsquo;re parents</h3>

<p>At least, that&rsquo;s the message this sort of tactic sends. I find it sadly ironic that supposed critics of institutionalized patriarchy (a very real and entrenched systemic problem in our society, particularly within capitalism itself), would deliberately reinforce the role of the corporation/employer as the judging, disciplining Father archetype.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post-img/1984.jpg"></p>

<p>I want to make it clear (if it isn&rsquo;t already) that this post is not intended as an attack on anyone, but as an externalization of my bewilderment at whether those who employ this tactic have fully thought through the implications of doing so.</p>

<p>Many of the people who seem to think this tactic is acceptable also tend to express a commitment to class politics (as well as politics of race and gender, and their intersectionality). This is a tactic that demonstrates a shocking lack of class solidarity. Deliberately attempting to destroy the employment or employability of a fellow worker out of spite is inexcusable.</p>

<p>Appealing to capital to enforce one&rsquo;s political agenda (no matter how noble that agenda might be) implicitly places that agenda as reliant upon and subject to capital itself. It&rsquo;s just plain bad politics.</p>

<p>And as Jon points out, it sets a terrible precedent. It expands the role of the employer to managing the totality of our lives, rather than limiting that influence to our professional lives. It changes us from professionals into frightened children.</p>

<h3>A culture of fear</h3>

<p>The prospect that one could lose one&rsquo;s livelihood, threatening the safety and security of one&rsquo;s family, over an online discussion, has a chilling, Orwellian feel. It&rsquo;s actually worse than that: whereas Orwell envisioned an omnipotent State punishing &ldquo;thoughtcrime,&rdquo; we have an emergent culture of fear in which no state intervention is necessary. The NSA might be reading my email, but they&rsquo;re not likely to get me fired.</p>

<p>I know whereof I speak. Some months ago, I was involved in a Twitter conversation about a study that showed that women on IRC were more likely to be harassed than men. While this seemed perfectly reasonable an observation, I (among others) had some questions about the methodology (e.g., literally women, or users with female-sounding handles, etc.). Attempting to inject some levity into what was becoming a tense discussion (something I would do IRL), I made an offhand reference to Rule 30 from the <a href="http://rulesoftheinternet.com/index.php?title=Main_Page">Rules of The Internet</a>, i.e., &ldquo;There are NO girls on the internet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not expect the vitriolic reaction that ensued, and once I realized that people had genuinely taken offense, I apologized. I did not verbally attack anyone or do anything but have a civil conversation about this one study, but I made a reference to a stupid meme without thinking anyone would react beyond eye-rolling.</p>

<p>A couple of days later, my COO, <a href="https://twitter.com/teachingdaisy">Margaret Roth</a> asked me about a weird voicemail she had received. Someone had called claiming to be interested in our company&rsquo;s services, but then went on at length saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you know what&rsquo;s going on in your development team, but your CTO tweeted that there were no women on the internet, and I&rsquo;m very concerned about the type of employees that you&rsquo;re hiring.&rdquo; No name or number left (odd for someone supposedly interested in the company&rsquo;s services), just accusations of poor management and supervision.</p>

<p>Upon reflection for this post, Margaret said, &ldquo;It was ridiculous that I was getting a call about this at all, let alone without citation. It&rsquo;s not my responsibility to police what you say on social media, especially in a case when I&rsquo;m getting blindly harassed for my management skills. If someone wanted to have an adult conversation with me about this, I&rsquo;d be happy to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m lucky enough to work for someone who treats me like an adult as well as a professional, and doesn&rsquo;t respond to anonymous attempts at character assassination, but it was a rather disturbing experience for both of us, and not everyone is so lucky.</p>

<p>I backed off from participation on Twitter for some time after that incident. It&rsquo;s never pleasant to be reminded that participating openly on the internet can (and often does) result in being doxxed and/or harassed in &ldquo;real life.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/whit537">@whit537</a> not everyone is in the privileged position of being able to have all kinds of shit on the internet &quot;openly&quot; w/out getting harassed</p>&mdash; Shanley (@shanley) <a href="https://twitter.com/shanley/statuses/467089426741338112">May 15, 2014</a></blockquote>

<h3>The decline of agency</h3>

<p>This is the first of (what I intend to be) a series of posts on what I perceive to be a decline of the concept of agency in socio-politico-cultural discourse. Whether it&rsquo;s the instant recourse to public Twitter-shaming rather than civil dialogue of <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2013/03/23/donglegate/">Donglegate</a>, or the infantilizing trend of employer-tattling, we are seeing a retreat from personal agency and a shift toward character assassination, public intimidation, and creating a culture of fear that is inimical to productive public discourse and debate. I can&rsquo;t speculate as to whether such discourse is even valued by the practitioners of these tactics, but one can&rsquo;t help but wonder.</p>

<p>Ash Taylor was just plain wrong to (publically or otherwise) refer to Shanley and Ashe as cunts. No excuse. But should he have gotten fired over it? Well, I suppose that&rsquo;s up to his (now former) employer, Livestream. But I wonder if Livestream would have reacted so quickly and drastically if they hadn&rsquo;t been prodded by such a polarizing figure with a degree of celebrity in the internet echo chamber.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also a bit interesting that the founder and CEO of Feminist Technology Collective, Inc. (i.e., someone who <em>cannot</em> be fired) is trying to get people fired and doesn&rsquo;t see (or willfully ignores, or gleefully exploits, but let&rsquo;s generously hope it&rsquo;s an innocent blind spot) the inherent privilege gap in that scenario. But that&rsquo;s a topic for another post.</p>

<p><em>The author would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/soederpop">Jon Soeder</a> for pushing me to finally write this, and <a href="https://twitter.com/teachingdaisy">Margaret Roth</a> for her editorial guidance and support.</em></p>

<p>Update: Comments are <a href="/blog/2014/06/10/on-comments-and-moderation/">now closed</a>, but there&rsquo;s plenty of discussion over on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7869644">Hacker News</a>.</p>

    <updated>2012-08-13T21:41:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://decomplecting.org/blog/2012/08/13/ladycoders</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, I had intended my next post to address some of the (valid) criticism of Github that&rsquo;s been making the rounds lately, but a much more disturbing Twitroversy has emerged today.</p>

<p>A group of women called <a href="http://ladycoders.com">LadyCoders</a> started a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/166494057/ladycoders-get-hired-seattle-2012">Kickstarter campaign</a> to fund a conference/seminar geared toward helping women to get programming and other tech jobs. Great idea, right? There are <a href="http://girldevelopit.com/">many</a> <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/">projects</a> devoted to giving women the skills they need to write software, but as far as addressing the fundamental issue that the industry itself is pretty much a boys' club (not assigning blame, just acknowledging reality), much less has been done in that area.</p>

<p>So the good folks at LadyCoders wanted to help get women <em>hired,</em> not just trained. Pretty cool.</p>

<p>Well, a lot of people thought so. As I write this, they&rsquo;re &lt; US$6k away from their US$23k funding goal. But&hellip; well, there was some dissent:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Sick and wrong: "it’s our job (for now) to be easily integrated into an all-male team, **nonthreatening,** and hyper-skilled"- <a href="https://twitter.com/ladycoders"><s>@</s><b>ladycoders</b></a></p>&mdash; Shanley Kane (@shanley) <a href="https://twitter.com/shanley/status/235163013227880449" data-datetime="2012-08-13T23:56:46+00:00">August 13, 2012</a></blockquote>


<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I completely get where @shanley is coming from&hellip; but the amount of Twitroversy here seemed&hellip; disproportionate.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Sorry for picking on @shanley so much, but&hellip; then there was this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Legit response from <a href="https://twitter.com/ladycoders"><s>@</s><b>ladycoders</b></a>: "I know what works, whether or not it's PC." Please do not fund this shit on kickstarter.</p>&mdash; Shanley Kane (@shanley) <a href="https://twitter.com/shanley/status/235166808880074753" data-datetime="2012-08-14T00:11:51+00:00">August 14, 2012</a></blockquote>


<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>You can go search for @ladycoders mentions on Twitter if you want to see more&hellip; but here&rsquo;s the issue I take: fundamentally, the issue LadyCoders is trying to address is that the software industry is a male-dominated space which has been difficult for even the most highly-skilled women to penetrate.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t speculate as to the eventual success or failure of LadyCoders as far as increasing the number of women working in software development or IT in general. But I do see the pragmatic value of a quasi-entryist, realpolitik solution to this problem.</p>

<p>Criticizing an organization trying to serve a real, valid feminist goal (material gains for women in a historically male-dominated sector), by all means necessary, just seems counter-productive. &ldquo;Seem non-threatening&rdquo; might be advice that highlights now fucked-up society is, but it isn&rsquo;t fucked-up advice if your goal is material gains for an oppressed group. Once you&rsquo;ve achieved your goals, shift the goalposts of &ldquo;(non-)threatening&rdquo; in the desired direction.</p>

<p>Queer/trans folks have been doing this for years, right? Really, everyone has&hellip; You don&rsquo;t go into your job interview in the clothes you wear to the club. If your subculture doesn&rsquo;t match, you don&rsquo;t interview in your bondage pants and Aus-Rotten t-shirt (old punk, here)&hellip; if who or what you are is out of the mainstream, you mute it depending on the culture of where you want a job.</p>

<p>For many folks, &ldquo;passing&rdquo; is an option. I think what LadyCoders is trying to highlight or confront (I hope they correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong) is that gender isn&rsquo;t really the issue, it&rsquo;s perception, stereotypes, and cultural bias; by ameliorating/sidestepping the (currently wrong and terrible) negative perception women sometimes have in techie circles, you have more opportunity to break down the perception.</p>

<p>You cover tattoos, take out piercings&hellip; none of this is <strong>right,</strong> but it&rsquo;s just how it is, and you need to get inside before you can try to change anything.</p>

<h3>Partial Measures</h3>

<p>While I appreciate the validity of realpolitik solutions, I also acknowledge that it&rsquo;s <em>fucking frustrating.</em></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Women, people of color, and other marginalized groups have been forced to work within the system forever. It's time to burn the system down.</p>&mdash; Ashe Dryden (@ashedryden) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashedryden/status/235167798211534848" data-datetime="2012-08-14T00:15:46+00:00">August 14, 2012</a></blockquote>


<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>There are few tweets I agree with more.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s this whole realpolitik thing.</p>

<p>The same sentiment that comes down so hard on LadyCoders (and seems to be responsible for <a href="http://ladycoders.tumblr.com/day/2012/08/13">some DDOS attacks</a>), echoes the sentiment that some &ldquo;anarchists&rdquo; (scare quotes belie my own prejudice) have against labor unions and other &ldquo;recuperative&rdquo; examples of self-organization by the proletariat and other oppressed groups.</p>

<p>Personally, I think it&rsquo;s time for a new social order. But until that order is ready to self-organize and build a new society from the ashes of the old, we need every possible means of achieving material gains for every group that has been deprived by our current society. And if that means women helping women to get their foot in the door at a <em>(for now)</em> male-dominated workplace, that&rsquo;s better than women <em>not</em> getting the opportunity to make incremental material gains.</p>

<p>I get the frustration, I do. I don&rsquo;t fault anyone (including those I embedded tweets from) for being frustrated. But attacking those who share your goals because they lack your ideological purity&hellip; that&rsquo;s a recipe for burning out without accomplishing anything. Stop it.</p>

<p>So I hope you will help LadyCoders reach their KickStarter goal; if it&rsquo;s a flop, well, something else will come along. If it&rsquo;s a success, hopefully more cynical, realpolitik, entryist projects will get more women into male-dominated fields and achieve positive change within those fields, and material gains for women.</p>

<h4>Personal Note</h4>

<p>This is my hacker blog, so I don&rsquo;t usually post anything related to my personal politics here. Other than my free software zealotry, I really think the set intersection of my professional and personal/political life is a narrow band indeed.</p>

<p>But this sort of goes to the heart of a number of overlapping conversations I&rsquo;ve been having of late, and I think the same sort of demand for a certain ideological purity is at the heart of many of these&hellip; so once it started to attack something I see as having a potential net positive effect on the software industry, and on the economic situation of women in general&hellip; I had to comment.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t fundamentally disagree with most of the criticism leveled toward LadyCoders on Twitter, either&hellip; I just think the caremad arguments are counterproductive, like most infighting.</p>

<p>Also&hellip; I don&rsquo;t necessarily think everything in their seminar is necessarily the best idea&hellip; but just because I <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/job_interview">wrote a gem to help with job interviews</a> doesn&rsquo;t mean I really know what women encounter in the hiring process. So I&rsquo;m willing to assume the ladies at LadyCoders know what they&rsquo;re doing better than I do.</p>

<p>Back to apolitical coding tips next post, I promise. Unless you&rsquo;re into that whole Steve Yegge liberal/conservative software engineering idea. In which case&hellip; you&rsquo;re on your own.</p>

<h4>UPDATE</h4>

<p>After I first posted this, the awesome @chriseppstein suggested all might not be legit:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Pretty sure you guys are getting trolled pretty hard by <a href="https://twitter.com/ladycoders"><s>@</s><b>ladycoders</b></a>.</p>&mdash; Chris Eppstein (@chriseppstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/chriseppstein/status/235210422477799424" data-datetime="2012-08-14T03:05:09+00:00">August 14, 2012</a></blockquote>


<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I don&rsquo;t think LadyCoders is a troll, but if it is, pretty damn epic, and I&rsquo;ll admit to be taken in. Either way, though, I think the analysis above holds true&hellip; feel free to disagree in the comments, however, as always.</p>
