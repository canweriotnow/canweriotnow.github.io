  <div class="entry-content"><p>In dealing with integrating data from disparate incomaptible systems (which I do to a degree that would drive some men mad), one of the most frequent irritations is dealing with datetime conversions.</p>

<p>A while ago, I <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2012/08/03/legacy-systems-on-rails-part-2/">wrote a post about Bubba</a> (not its real name), a legacy/vendor-supplied system in which the original developers (may they suffer eternal torment) decided to store all datetimes as floating-point values using a bastardized form of the Julian Day system with fractional day part. In that post, I showed a solution used in a Ruby on Rails web app, but now I&#8217;m writing data integration services for multiple systems, and needed something a bit more robust, so I&#8217;m writing it in Clojure.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll start off with the dependencies:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I&#8217;m using the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/clj-time">clj-time</a> library by Sean Corfield. It&#8217;s basically a wrapper around the <a href="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/">Joda Time</a> Java library, allowing us to use its powerful datetime handling in idiomatic Clojure.</p>

<p>So, for the actual code. First, the Bubba dates need to be converted to and from a floating point value to a normal Date object.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I don&#8217;t blog much about my gaming habit, but I recently got my invite to <a href="http://www.ingress.com">Ingress</a>, Google&#8217;s new location-based MMORPG. Much has been written about the extensive (one might even say brilliant) <a href="http://www.nianticproject.com">viral marketing campaign</a> that launched the game, and there has been some interesting speculation as to Google&#8217;s motivation in producing such a game, ranging from the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/138res/google_launches_ingress_a_worldwide_mobile/c71v7yv?context=2">begrudgingly admiring</a> to the <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/11/19/googles-ingress-is-more-than-a-game-its-a-potential-data-exploitation-disaster/">borderline paranoid</a>.</p>

<p>True, a persistently location-aware app that collects GPS and accelerometer data the entire time it&#8217;s active has obvious implications for a data-ravenous company like Google. And I&#8217;ve seen a few reasonable theories so far as to the &#8220;real&#8221; motivation behind the game (and Google&#8217;s &#8220;real&#8221; motivation - always and everywhere - is surely data). A breakdown of what I&#8217;ve seen so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ingress is about tracking player &#8220;areas of operation&#8221; - the assumption being that you&#8217;ll be playing most in the areas you habituate anyway - harvesting data for better location-targeted ads. Google is essentially an advertising company, so this makes sense.</li>
<li>Ingress is about improving Google Maps with pedestrian and footpath data - the Maps product is pretty great for driving, but as for routing pedestrian traffic, well&#8230; I&#8217;ve had it suggest a longer route because the shorter would involve <em>walking</em> the &#8220;wrong way&#8221; down a one-way street. Walking directions are improving, but they rarely suggest cutting through a park, for instance, even when it would save 20 min. traveling time. And that kind of data is hard to get in an automated fashion, and often involves undocumented local knowledge. Using Ingress not only gets players to collect footpath data, but leverages local knowledge of pedestrian routes.</li>
</ol>


<p>I think both of these theories are probably accurate, but they don&#8217;t go far enough.</p>

<p>It was actually during an extended period of playing Ingress last week that it occurred to me&#8230; I was plotting a run around the college campus where I work and thought to myself, wouldn&#8217;t it be a neat feature if the game could help me plot the most efficient route between all these portals.</p>

<h5>Yeah. See it yet?</h5>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been following with great interest the recent debate over DCI vs. Concerns vs. Whatever in Ruby. The best take I&#8217;ve seen, however, is Tony Arcieri&#8217;s recent post, <a href="http://tonyarcieri.com/dci-in-ruby-is-completely-broken">&#8220;DCI&#8221; in Ruby Is Compeltely Broken</a>.</p>

<p>Reading his post, it ocurred to me that what Rubyists are trying to do with <code>object.extend(Module)</code> is precisely what Lisp hackers have been doing for years with macros, but it&#8217;s an ugly hack when applied in the wrong paradigm (or, at least, the wrong language).</p>

<p>Now, I was initially a big fan <em>conceptually</em> of DCI. It seemed intuitive, even familiar. And it helped that it was the brainchild of Trygve Reenskaug, the erstwhile inventor of MVC, possibly one of the most useful OOP patterns ever devised.</p>

<p>But the more familiar it seemed, the more difficult it seemed to implement properly, much less efficiently, even in the purest of modern OO languages, i.e., Ruby.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I tried to forget everything I knew about OOP that its familiarity became clear: this novel appropach to object-oriented design is embedded in the most natural thing in the world in the oldest of functional programming languages, Lisp.</p>

<p>Enter the macro. In Clojure, providing context to a function is straightforward using a macro, for instance, a database query (n.b., most of this is straight example code from <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org">wikibooks.org</a>).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using the simplest of (admittedly cribbed) examples here for the sake of demonstration, but right away here, we&#8217;ve got the D and C of DCI - Data and Context. As for interaction&#8230; we could easily conceive of a <code>with-role</code> macro which determines the interaction of the database connection and the actual application of the <code>with-connection</code> macro, whether it invokes a SELECT, CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.</p>

<p>In a Lisp, this level of composition is completely <em>natural,</em> is my point. In a language like Ruby (which despite having much of the Lisp nature, is OO to its core), and especially in a framework like Rails, with its cargo-cult Design Pattern-worshipping user base (I&#8217;m going to take some shit for that one, but accept that I&#8217;m exaggerating and flame with that in mind), is it any surprise that a pattern that makes <em>total sense</em> in an FP context is going to be a hot controversy in an OOP context?</p>

<p>I agree with Tony&#8217;s post that &#8220;DCI&#8221; in Rails is totally broken. But that&#8217;s because, IMHO, DCI isn&#8217;t the best pattern for OOP. Yeah, Ruby has <em>lots</em> of functional features, but maybe we need to rethink how we&#8217;re doing this DCI stuff (or Concerns, or whatever), on the basis that messing with inheritance and the class hierarchy is the <em>wrong thing,</em> and perhaps we should be creatively exploring the use of blocks and lambdas and Ruby&#8217;s other functional constructs.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not offering any solutions here, but I&#8217;m hoping I can contribute to the conversation. Step away from the mixins, away from the class hierarchy, away from the object model. Maybe take another read of Design Patterns and see if DCI is another hot YAGNI thing. I don&#8217;t know yet. I just know it reminds me of how things are AWESOME in a whole other paradigm that doesn&#8217;t necessarily apply to your Rails app.</p>

<p>As a caveat, I should say that I haven&#8217;t really tried to use this DCI mojo in a production application, although I have played with different ideas about it Just For Fun&copy;. If you think I&#8217;m wrong, or have the whole thing arse-about-face, I&#8217;d be happy to discuss it in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a while since my last post in this series (if you missed them, here are parts <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2012/08/02/legacy-systems-on-rails-part-1/">one</a> and <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2012/08/03/legacy-systems-on-rails-part-2/">two</a>) but I wanted to return to the topic of building out Rails applications on top of legacy systems.</p>

<h3>Abstraction is your friend</h3>

<p>I think if there&#8217;s a common theme in these posts, it&#8217;s abstraction. Primarily, using Ruby and Rails to abstract away the crazy implementation details of a system that&#8217;s been accumulating cruft for over twenty years. I&#8217;m going to start referring to this system as &#8220;Bubba&#8221; for the sake of convenience (and since I don&#8217;t have permission from the vendor to say what it actually is).</p>

<p>I mentioned in Part One that most of the access to the backend system going forward is occurring via a REST API wrapping the Oracle database that serve&#8217;s as Bubba&#8217;s back-end. Today I wanted to look at how the user-facing portions are constructed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sadly, I haven&#8217;t added a blog post in roughly 2.5 months. I&#8217;ve had ideas for posts, but when it came time to set pen to page (or fingers to keyboard, as teh case may be) I just haven&#8217;t had it in me. I really enjoy writing this blog, too. I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what was going on, until I read one of the most insightful blog posts I&#8217;ve ever seen: <a href="http://edu.mkrecny.com/thoughts/be-nice-to-programmers">Be Nice To Programmers</a>.</p>

<p>The tl;dr is a dialogue between a programmer and a guy who wishes he had the chops because he thinks coding is the neatest job in the world. The programmer tells him he thinks coding is making him miserable because the the development/debug process is the ultimate negative feedback loop.</p>

<blockquote><p>My workflow is something like this.</p><p>write some code<br/>run the code<br/>get an error message<br/>find the error and back to step 1<br/>Hour by hour, day after day, I do this. Always searching for what&#8217;s wrong with what I&#8217;m creating, rarely thinking about what&#8217;s good about it. It&#8217;s a negative reinforcement feedback loop.</p><footer><strong>[http://edu.mkrecny.com/thoughts/be-nice-to-programmers]</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='The main reason to become a programmer is that the position of &#8216;God&#8217; is unavailable. Your _job_ is to create universes where the fundamental laws of nature, so to speak, are completely under your creative control.'>
I definitely get the sentiment. But I think of this as the inner loop in the red-green-refactor cycle, so to speak. Yeah, coding (<em>especially</em> doing proper TDD) is going to make you hate the world (and possibly feel like an idiot) sometimes. But overall&#8230; I was in a job interview a few weeks ago, and was asked why I love being a programmer. I didn&#8217;t even have to think about my response: The main reason to become a programmer is that the position of &#8216;God&#8217; is unavailable. Your <em>job</em> is to create universes where the fundamental laws of nature, so to speak, are completely under your creative control. Ultimately, that&#8217;s the takeaway: programming is <em>awesome.</em> But a job is still a job, and I think that&#8217;s where some of the negative feedback loop comes in.
</span></p>

<p>My last post was just before a huge project I&#8217;d both originated and put a large amount of my time and effort into over the course of 15-18 months was shelved. It was ready to ship, but corporate politics being what it is (i.e., something I&#8217;d schedule a root canal to avoid, <em>especially</em> where I work), I tried to just move on and not lose sleep over it. Still, it rankled.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I had intended my next post to address some of the (valid) criticism of Github that&#8217;s been making the rounds lately, but a much more disturbing Twitroversy has emerged today.</p>

<p>A group of women called <a href="http://ladycoders.com">LadyCoders</a> started a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/166494057/ladycoders-get-hired-seattle-2012">Kickstarter campaign</a> to fund a conference/seminar geared toward helping women to get programming and other tech jobs. Great idea, right? There are <a href="http://girldevelopit.com/">many</a> <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/">projects</a> devoted to giving women the skills they need to write software, but as far as addressing the fundamental issue that the industry itself is pretty much a boys&#8217; club (not assigning blame, just acknowledging reality), much less has been done in that area.</p>

<p>So the good folks at LadyCoders wanted to help get women <em>hired,</em> not just trained. Pretty cool.</p>

<p>Well, a lot of people thought so. As I write this, they&#8217;re &lt; US$6k away from their US$23k funding goal. But&#8230; well, there was some dissent:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Sick and wrong: &#8220;it’s our job (for now) to be easily integrated into an all-male team, **nonthreatening,** and hyper-skilled&#8221;- <a href="https://twitter.com/ladycoders"><s>@</s><b>ladycoders</b></a></p>&mdash; Shanley Kane (@shanley) <a href="https://twitter.com/shanley/status/235163013227880449" data-datetime="2012-08-13T23:56:46+00:00">August 13, 2012</a></blockquote>


<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I completely get where @shanley is coming from&#8230; but the amount of Twitroversy here seemed&#8230; disproportionate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One thing I&#8217;ve come to observe working in higher ed is that you can run into a lot of issues with what I want to term &#8220;generational impedance mismatch.&#8221; It&#8217;s what happens when your ostensible customers are about 40 years older than your target demographic.</p>

<p>When I started on an internal administrative application about two years ago, I threw in some error pages with lolcats on them because&#8230; well, error pages are boring. Those got yanked because the customer thought they were &#8220;unprofessional.&#8221; Okay, sure. It&#8217;s an administrative app, so maybe this isn&#8217;t the best thing to throw up after a catastrophic failure:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post-img/im-in-ur-serverz.jpeg"></p>

<p>But the new crop of apps I&#8217;m writing don&#8217;t target middle-aged administrators; they target students. Specifically, in addition to doing mundane things like reporting your a lost ID card or checking balances, there&#8217;s a whole social gaming component. So far, I&#8217;ve been pretty successful at keeping things amusing (between the student focus group we assembled and the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/jhu">JHU subreddit</a>, my sense of humor is quickly vindicated), but the text is&#8230; kinda stodgy.</p>

<p>I was discussing this with a co-worker, and we hit on what I think is a brilliant way of balancing conflicting stakeholder needs. The customer wants rather formal, business-like text that drily describes various functions of the application. On the other hand, students are going to be bored, and love easter eggs and humor. But we know how to deal with target demographics who speak different languages, don&#8217;t we? Localization to the rescue!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This will be a quick one. I just wanted to give an example of how Ruby&#8217;s open classes can be a lifesaver when a vendor makes bizarre choices, which you then have to deal with.</p>

<h3>Into the mouth of madness</h3>

<p>So let&#8217;s imagine you&#8217;re a software engineer (actually, to make a decision this crazy, you&#8217;d probably have to have a title like Señor Software Architect, or possibly VP of Development). You need to store precise date values for an OLTP system in the database. Although you know that Oracle&#8217;s TIMESTAMP datatype will store a time right down to sub-millisecond precision, that&#8217;s just too easy. Or, at least, too sane.</p>

<p>Then you remember the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day">Julian day</a> system. Perfect! You can just use floats to reperesent the time, with the Julian day number as the integral part, and the time of day represented as the fractional part! Even better, you decide to make up your own offset instead of using a standard Day of Calendar Reform, <em>and</em> to store the local time instead of UTC.</p>

<p>If you have ever considered something like this, step away from the computer. I&#8217;m revoking your programmer license. Leaving aside the general inaccuracy of floats (you wouldn&#8217;t use a float to represent money, why the hell would it be a good idea for time?), there are <em>existing datatypes</em> for this! Moving on&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Much of my job consists of providing customized or novel interfaces for a complex legacy system which, although still maintained by the vendor (who shall remain nameless), does not currently (nor do I ever expect it to) meet many of our institutional needs.</p>

<p>Since I spend a lot of time on this, I figured it would be a good topic for a series of posts, hence the &#8220;Part 1&#8221; in the title. Hopefully I&#8217;ll actually follow through on it.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to replace a few aging Perl CGI scripts with a Rails app, which was interesting. The notion that Rails is far easier to use for greenfield projects than for legacy systems is probably accurate, but it&#8217;s not universally true.</p>

<p>This back-end is an Oracle database with over 450 tables and a hodgepodge of different strategies for how relationships should be modeled. I&#8217;m pretty sure it was my second or third day on the job that I was asked to implement a feature (in the old Perl codebase) that should have been straightforward given the relationships between two particular entities, but ended up requiring six inner joins and two left outer joins, IIRC. Just to give you an idea of what I&#8217;m dealing with.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the first time around, I wrote an ActiveRecord model for each table, did my <code>has_many</code>&#8217;s and <code>belongs_to</code>&#8217;s, et cetera. Some were easier than others. There were a <em>lot</em> of conditions hashes in some of those associations.</p>

<p>When the project scope started to grow beyond a single web app, and I started designing a REST API for the system, I had the opportunity to scratch some of the itches that had been bugging me about the original implementation from the very beginning.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, <a href="http://coursera.com">Coursera</a> announced that 12 more universities had joined their program of creating massive open online courses, or MOOCs (one of them was <a href="http://www.jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a>, where I work, so I was especially excited&#8230; we&#8217;re not always &#8220;early adopters&#8221;).</p>

<p>Coursera is extremely cool. I&#8217;m currently taking UC Berkely&#8217;s <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/saas">Software Engineering for SaaS</a> class (nothing new for me so far, but it&#8217;s enjoyable), and I took the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">Machine Learning</a> class earlier this year. Well, most of it&#8230; I got a little too busy with work and family and didn&#8217;t quite finish. But I still learned a lot, and used math I thought I&#8217;d forgotten. So all in all, a win.</p>

<p>Not quite finishing is a common thread in my life. I&#8217;m just a few credits away from a Bachelor&#8217;s in philosophy. Also, graphic design. Probably computer science as well. My Achilles&#8217; heel was always General Education courses. I want to learn almost everything I possibly can, but generally I either want to learn something so I can do something with it, or learn something because I have a compelling fascination with the topic. Most Gen Ed courses did neither for me, and when I&#8217;m not interested, I&#8217;m not motivated. This might be a character flaw. Two universities so far seemed to think so.</p>

<p>It seems like the whole obsession with &#8220;general education&#8221; is dying. Johns Hopkins, for instance, has no general requirements, only departmental requirements for majors (and minors, natch). That&#8217;s extremely cool. It also costs over US$50k a year to attend. That&#8217;s not so cool.</p>
