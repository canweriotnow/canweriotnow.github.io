  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I conceived of this post, it was going to be about how damn awesome <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> is. And it certainly is awesome; it powers this blog, and makes writing it a joy, whereas trying to use <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>, <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a>, or even newer alternatives like <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> or <a href="http://postero.us">Posterous</a> was downright painful. But what I&rsquo;m more interested in is the growing trend among apps, services, and even operating systems that has made projects like Octopress necessary.</p>

<h3>The Tragedy of Google</h3>

<p>For such a long time, Google did search better than many of us ever dreamt <em>possible</em> in the pre-Google days. But it wasn&rsquo;t just the intelligence of the search algorithms, or the massive cache and index behind Google search. Google made it possible to craft a finely-honed query from the front page, with excellent support for literal strings, boolean operators, required inclusion/exclusion, etc. And then came Google+.</p>

<p>Google&rsquo;s commitment to search had been on the decline for a while, it seems&hellip; the only new features search had acquired in years were fairly useless things like page previews and, briefly, Twitter integration. Because that&rsquo;s integral to search.</p>

<p>But when Google launched its abortion of a social network, usable search had to go. Not only did they kill one of the <a href="http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/websearch/3oIWbew9xdE">most useful search operators</a> (Boolean +), but they also started filtering search results based on social connections in Google+. While this doesn&rsquo;t <em>always</em> end in having to re-search without &ldquo;personal&rdquo; results, I have a feeling that&rsquo;s only because I&rsquo;m connected to so many developers on Google+. But if Google+ hadn&rsquo;t been such an abject failure, my mom might be on there, and we typically search about very different kinds of &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo;  The situation with Google is so bad at this point, that I often get better results from <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a>, which wraps a ton of different search engines and websites, and attempts to break the &ldquo;filter bubble&rdquo; by presenting hte same results to everyone. I like this in principle, but I miss Google&rsquo;s synchronized search history and habit of learning what results are relevant to me to (usually) provide better results.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every now and then someone comes to me for advice because they (or someone they know) wants to learn to code and has no idea where to start. Usually, the first thing I do is send them to <a href="http://tryruby.org">tryruby.org</a>, the awesome web-based REPL and tutorial the <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a> folks put together, based on <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/">_why&rsquo;s (poignant) guide to ruby</a>.</p>

<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been wondering if that&rsquo;s the best advice. Only because I constantly re-evaluate <em>everything</em> on the chance that it might be sub-optimal. Ruby is pretty easy to learn, but it&rsquo;s also easy to learn terrible, terrible habits. Maybe a more constraining language would be more suitable?</p>

<p>I have to admit, as much as I generally <a href="http://decomplecting.org/blog/2012/05/18/un-pythonic-for-fun-and-profit/">dislike Python</a>, it probably <em>is</em> the easiest language to learn, and it rarely gives you enough rope to hang yourself. So am I just letting my own prejudices guide my recommendations to other people?</p>

<time datetime="2012-05-30T13:26:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">2012-05-30</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two of the best presentations at RailsConf this year, <strong>Designing Hypermedia APIs</strong> by <a href="http://steveklabnik.com/">Steve Klabnik</a> and <strong>Rails: The Next Five Years</strong> by <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/">Yehuda Katz</a> were related to the topic of hypermedia APIs. The video of Steve&rsquo;s talk isn&rsquo;t up on Confreaks yet, but the slides are <a href="http://steveklabnik.github.com/hypermedia-presentation/#1">here</a>. I&rsquo;ll embed Yehuda&rsquo;s talk right here:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UlMpIHH1K5s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The two big takeaways from these talks (for me, at least):</p>

<ol>
<li>We&rsquo;ve come a long way in designing in implementing APIs. But now we&rsquo;re to the &ldquo;hard part&rdquo;: Going from REST to true hypermedia.</li>
<li>Rails is really, really good at creating de facto standards via &ldquo;convention over configuration.&rdquo; But we don&rsquo;t go far enough, and that&rsquo;s where we shoot ourselves in the foot (think ActiveResource).</li>
</ol>


<h3>Why don&rsquo;t you REST for a while?</h3>

<p>I know, it&rsquo;s stressful figuring this stuff out.  Rails going all RESTful was a big help when it came to creating uniform interfaces for our applications. HTML, XML, JSON&hellip; you could have it your way, right away. But going from RESTful resources to true hypermedia APIs is an even bigger leap forward than the move to REST, and that transition also needs to be planned and implemented carefully and correctly.</p>

<p><code>as_json</code> will only get you so far. Yes, it will represent the resource in a way that is eminently consumable by a client application, whether that&rsquo;s Javascript in the browser, a mobile app, or curl. But your client still needs to know <em>far</em> too much about the structure of the resources on your server. That&rsquo;s tight coupling, which we all know is evil. It&rsquo;s even evilly-tight from a REST standpoint; if the client has to know <em>anything</em> about server-side resources, you&rsquo;re breaking the encapsulation layer between resources and the representation of those resources, which is what REST is all about, right?</p>

<p>So what is to be done?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a long time, Jason Fried&rsquo;s article <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110401/jason-fried-why-i-run-a-flat-company.html">Why I Run a Flat Company</a> has seemed like an unrealistic dream that only works in rarified pockets of hacker utopia.</p>

<p>You have to understand, I work for an institution which, between the university, hospital(s), and various other divisions, employs over 40k people, enrolls over 20k students, treats countless patients, and who knows how many vendors and contractors add complexity to the mix.</p>

<p>But I still think there&rsquo;s something to this &ldquo;flat company&rdquo; idea. My team is a bit of an oddity, and I think that&rsquo;s what allows us to be agile and innovative in a way that&rsquo;s impossible for most of the other software teams. The team is, on an org chart, pretty much flat. We have a team lead, to whom we <em>don&rsquo;t</em> report (on paper).</p>

<p>Let me backtrack a bit. In interest of full disclosure, I do have a bit of a cognitive bias in favor of flat organizations. My lefty politics tend toward anarchist-communism, so I have a certain degree of distrust for <em>any</em> hierarchy. I think this goes back to the important distinction between <em>having</em> authority and <em>being an</em> authority. The difference between a bestowed, arbitrary power, and the innate power of being intelligent, capable, and well-informed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m finally reading <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com">Chad Fowler</a>&rsquo;s excellent book, <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer</a>, and in it he recounts an experience that was chillingly familiar.</p>

<p>A music major, Chad fell into working at his university&rsquo;s IT department as if by accident. Initially, he was worried that his lack of professional experience or training would prove an embarrassment; after all, here he was working alongside people with advanced degrees in computer science.</p>

<blockquote><p>Within a few days of work, the truth started to sink in. These people don&rsquo;t know what the hell they&rsquo;re doing! In fact, some people were watching me work and taking notes! People with master&rsquo;s degrees in computer science!</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="float-left" src="/images/passionate-programmer.png"></p>

<p>I can definitely relate. I work at a university as well, and it&rsquo;s actually my first formal software development position. I&rsquo;ve been coding as part of my job (and my full-time hobby) for years&hellip; as far back as high school, in fact. I learned BASIC on a Texas Instruments 99/4A when I was 4 or 5. But prior to this, my paid software development work had either been freelance stuff or encountering a problem in a non-technical job that I could solve faster by hacking something together.</p>

<p>I work on a small team on which I&rsquo;m the only full-time developer (I&rsquo;ll come back to this later). Recently, IT had a major re-org which put my team under a new director and in the same organizational unit as a large team of developers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post isn&rsquo;t meant to play into some hacker holy war, nor is it intended to denigrate the usefulness of Python for various tasks. Steve Yegge has done <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/tour-de-babel">a much better job than I can</a> of explicating some of the issues other programmers have with Python, both the language and the community around it; I still agree with his remarks there.</p>

<p>But there <em>are</em> some (major, IMHO) issues with the &ldquo;Pythonic&rdquo; attitude toward programming. And they start with &ldquo;The Zen of Python.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The Zen of Python</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to like about <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">The Zen of Python</a>. On the first face of it, it&rsquo;s a pretty good set of principles:</p>

<pre><code>Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
</code></pre>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot here that would be attractive, if not obvious, to any given Rubyist or Clojurian. I think the problem is that Pythonistas tend to get hung up on the <em>bad</em> elements of the &ldquo;Zen of Python&rdquo;, to the detriment of the positive ones. So I&rsquo;ll just go through some of the ones that cause the most friction with non-Pythonistas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I wanted to plug a little project that <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/micahjgates">Micah Gates</a> and I hacked together at <a href="http://railsconf.austinonrails.org/bohconf">BohConf</a>, the awesome un-conference and hackfest that runs parallel to <a href="http://railsconf2012.com">RailsConf</a> each year.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://github.com/ruby-jokes/job_interview">job_interview</a>, and it&rsquo;s a Ruby gem to automate some of the tedium of programmer job interviews.</p>

<p>As an example, let&rsquo;s take <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html">FizzBuzz</a>, a typical interview screening question intended to weed out the applicants who can&rsquo;t write code to save their lives. In Ruby, you might implement FizzBuzz like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>FizzBuzz</span><a href='https://github.com/ruby-jokes/job\_interview/blob/master/lib/job\_interview/fizz\_buzz.rb'>link</a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But that&rsquo;s just tedious. With job_interview, it&rsquo;s dead simple:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>job_interview FizzBuzz</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It also does Fibonacci sequences (recursive, iterative, and matrix strategies), a quine, the first <em>n</em> primes, and, of course, &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That wasn&rsquo;t enough, though.</p>

<p>It will also answer the bullshit personal questions that everyone lies about anyway!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Machine Beauty</h3>

<p><img class="float-left" src="http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1171573120l/107615.jpg" width="250"></p>

<p>In his essay <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107615.Machine_Beauty">Machine Beauty</a>, David Gelernter defines &ldquo;machine beauty&rdquo; as an inspired mating of simplicity and power. In software, I think this is also what we mean when we talk about &ldquo;elegance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Dijkstra quote that serves as a tagline for this blog is actually truncated; the full quote reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>Elegance is not a dispensable luxury but a quality that decides between success and failure.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is not (necessarily) an economic truth; few people would describe any product from Microsoft as elegant, but they have been economically successful. However, the painful experience of using Microsoft software, the unreliability of both systems and applications, the general clunkiness of Windows applications, indicates that the software here is indeed a failure.</p>

<p>Software is a failure when it becomes an obstacle to productivity rather than an aid to it; when you must serve the compiler (or interpreter) rather than the compiler serving you (think Java boilerplate). From an end-user standpoint, the failure comes when the interface imposes unnatural workflows and ceremony that interrupts the natural flow of completing a task.</p>

<p>Software is successful when you hardly notice it&rsquo;s there; when it becomes a natural extension of the self, an augmentation to human ability. In terms of systems, think of the Macintosh when it was introduced; nothing before had been so intuitive, and enabling. In terms of programming languages, Ruby leaps immediately to mind. It is so expressive that it no longer feels like &ldquo;coding&rdquo;; you are just expressing your thoughts in a syntax that feels almost immediately as natural as a spoken language.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to retire my old blog, which had devolved into a platform for rants rather than anything truly worthwhile&hellip; to me, anyhow. Sure, my rants were amusing at times, and people seemed to enjoy them, but that&rsquo;s not the point of blogging for me.</p>

<p>I want to talk about things that really matter, which (for me) includes simple, powerful code that works the way it is intended to.</p>

<p>So, trying this blogging thing again.</p>
