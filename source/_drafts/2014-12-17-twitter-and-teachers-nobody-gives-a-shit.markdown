Recently, [Lindsey Lipskey](https://twitter.com/LindseyLipsky) posted an article titled [The T in Twitter Stands for Teacher](http://lindseylipsky.weebly.com/blog/the-t-in-twitter-stands-for-teacher).

That's cool. I'm not sure which 't' she was referring to, as there are three t's in "Twitter", but whatev's.

Let me take a few steps back. Last year, when I suggested Twitter's [#edchat](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23edchat&src=typd) might not being the ideal place to discuss issues of privilege in education, I got quite the tongue-lashing from  one of #edchat's founder's Tom Whitby, in the pos [Sometimes a Chat Is Just A Chat(http://tomwhitby.wordpress.com/2014/01/27/sometimes-a-chat-is-just-a-chat/). It's really an ironic post, if you review his blog and discover the ABSOLUTE UNIVERSAL AND PARADIGM-SHIFTING IMPORTANCE OF #EDCHAT, or even discover tweets like this, from recent memory:
