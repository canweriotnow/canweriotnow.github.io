When we at [An Estuary](http://anestuary.com) set out to build [edsavr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/edsavr-collect-save-share/dbmmeflmfblomgcoenojhbdjjljchcni) as a [Field Lab](http://dev.anestuary.com/fieldlabs) project, our decision to build a [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) extension wasn't a matter of convenience or accident. Okay, there was a little convenience involved: Chrome has the most developer-friendly extension ecosystem in the market. And we're not masochists. So there's that. But we also have another perspective. Most of us come from teaching backgrounds in one way or another; either as educators, the family of educators, or people who have worked with EdTech long enough to know how farkakte the whole ecosystem is. 

In many cases, teachers are pretty much forced to use old versions of Internet Explorer...

...and that's not okay. Hell, a bunch of the "enterprise" software school districts buy still rely on Java applets that break every time a [security fix is released](http://ucttraining.wordpress.com/2013/10/21/powerschool-java-issue/). I don't know how the bar is so low for software in a sector so critical to our economic future. Then again, I don't know how the bar is so low on damn near everything relating to education. 

In regards to my own educational experiences, I hearken back to Johnny Rotten at the last-ever Sex Pistols show:

{% blockquote Johnny Rotten %}
  Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?
{% endblockquote %}

But that's the topic for another post. But teachers using the standard, 1990's-grade edtech most districts provide (and suffering BYOD-restrictions and absurd levels of centralized control) should definitely have the feeling they've been cheated. 

Because they have.

### EdTech DIY

My mom was never a programmer. Nothing near it. But she did create an effective an popular gradebook program (as well as systems for class rosters, etc.) for her school and others in the late 90's (before crappy vendors were _de rigeur_). 

[My company](http://anestuary.com) is trying to create teacher-centric, non-crappy software for professional development; we hope you'll like it. And we hope that if you have problems with it, you'll let us know, because we actually care about the classroom experience, and we'll endeavour to improve whatever we can, whenever we can.

But back to this DIY concept: 

One of _my_ goals as an EdTech developer is to provide tools that can help teachers to build their own tools. I don't expect every teacher to become a developer, but I know some of you are
