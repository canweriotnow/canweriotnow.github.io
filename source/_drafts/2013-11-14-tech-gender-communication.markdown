I've really tried to stay out of discussions of gender and feminism on the Interwubs because I tend to piss off a certain subspecies of [RadFem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_feminism), but I was recently encouraged by a colleague not to self-censor when I have (in her perspective) valid contibutions to make ot the discussion.

I'm not blameless. I'll be the first to admit I don't catch social cues, I have the emotional intelligence of a whelk, and I have a penchant for "friendly trolling" (I consider "friendly trolling" to be internet-culture teasing not _intended_ to piss people off, but intent doesn't really matter, does it?).

I also tend to get my jimmies extremely rustled when a comment or observation offered in good faith results in self-righteous attack. We'll return to this topic shortly.

I have a new mantra, and I'm going to try to live by it:

I think there are a number of reasons the internet dialog is unconstructive, and I'll try to enumerate them (at least in part) here.
