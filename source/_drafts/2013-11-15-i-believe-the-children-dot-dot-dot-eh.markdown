Okay, sorry, clearly trolling with the citation... J.K. blatantly borrowed it from Matthew 6:21. I don't get the anti-Harry Potter Chirstians; if you've read the books, it's one of the most Christin allegories since Dante; ironic that the Evangelicals broke away (partially) on the basis that everyone should read the Bible, but few of them seem to read anything... but, I digress.

This is about education.

Michael Church recently wrote about the Teacher-Executive problem in [this post](http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/11/03/software-engineer-salaries-arent-inflated-at-least-not-for-the-99/), but the tl;dr is that teacher salaries remain low because they're socially necessary, and in great numbers; executives are more or less superfluous, and few and far between, so we don't mind paying CEO's seven-figure salaries with golden parachutes.

This is fucked.

#### Professionalism

One of the problems (really, the main target) [An Estuary](http://anestuary.com) is trying to solve in education is the state of professional development.

I recently pointed out that one of the problems is that teaching isn't taken seriously as a profession. Doctors, lawyers, architects, engineers, etc., are expected to spend up to _forty percent of their time on the job in continuing education._ The immediate response (from educators within our team!) was: "There's no money for that in education."

I didn't know what to say.

If you ask anyone able to extract their head from their own anus about the main concerns for our economic future, STEM education will top the list... but we're not willing to make the investment in _basic education?_

Are we competing for the [Darwin Awards](http://www.darwinawards.com/) here?

#### What. The. Actual. Fuck.

Yeah. This is the facepalm moment I'm talking about.

One facepalm _clearly_ isn't enough.

I've often referenced Marc Andreesen's article in the WSJ, ["Why Software Is Eating The World"](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460). You know what it's choking on? Education. And that's a problem.

Software is eating the world that can afford it. And moreover, the world that can effectively purchase and implement it. Part of the problem in education is that software is being designed by people with no experience in education, and purchased by people who know nothing about software. There aren't enough facepalms for this.

I know education in this country is inefficient. We have this aversion to tracking. GT education is a fucking joke (this, from personal experience). But for Christ's sake, in the big picture, the attitude toward education policy makes me hope for the extinction of the human race. The planet would be better off without us if we don't put the value into education we put into fucking iPhones.
