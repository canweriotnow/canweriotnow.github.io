Let me preface this post with a few _a priori_ assumptions:

* There should absolutely be more women in STEM fields. the male domination of this sector is absurd.
* I think groups like [GirlDevelopIt](http://www.girldevelopit.com/), [RailsBridge](http://railsbridge.org/), and the host of other orgs trying to encourage young women to get into software are amazing, and deserve our full support.
* I'm glad there's such a major push to get [computing in the core](http://www.computinginthecore.org/) curriculum, and I believe it's essential.
