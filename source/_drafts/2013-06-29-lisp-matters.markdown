Like many of my blog posts, this one was inspired by a Twitter interaction:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>vim-slime + pry. just get amongst it</p>&mdash; Jonathan Soeder (@soederpop) <a href="https://twitter.com/soederpop/statuses/350873799215951873">June 29, 2013</a></blockquote>

While I think Paul Graham's essay, ["Revenge of The Nerds"](http://paulgraham.com/icad.html) is a great place to start, it really doesn't explain just why Lisp is so important. Not really.

I could equally well point you to any number of Steve Yegge's [Drunken Blog Rants](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/blog-rants), such as [Lisp Wins (I Think)](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/lisp-wins), or [Scheming Is Believing](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/scheming-is-believing), or [Tour de Babel](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/tour-de-babel). Maybe the most influential would be [Lisp is Not An Acceptable Lisp](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/04/lisp-is-not-acceptable-lisp.html), and it might be the most germane, as the tweet proviking this post references Ruby, and the post provoking Stevey's article argues that Ruby (!) is an acceptable Lisp.

I don't want to discuss what constitutes an acceptable Lisp. I'm more interested in why an acceptable (or unacceptable) Lisp matters, and why we should care.
