One of the more interesting HN/Twitter debates in the past week was the discussion over the potentially exclusionary nature of OSS contirbutions as hiring criterion. It started (I think) with [a post](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2013/the-perils-of-mixing-open-source-and-money.html) from (DHH)[https://twitter.com/dhh] on mixing open source and money. [Ashe Dryden](https://twitter.com/ashedryden) responded with an unusually [well-reasoned post](http://ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community) about the statistical corellation between race & gender privilege and open source contributions. It was very well argued, but it did raise certain questions in my mind.
