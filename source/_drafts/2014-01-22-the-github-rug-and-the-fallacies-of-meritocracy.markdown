[GitHub](https://github.com) took some heat from the likes of [Valleywag](http://valleywag.gawker.com) for building a [replica of the oval office](http://valleywag.gawker.com/how-not-to-spend-your-startups-money-a-replica-of-the-1265655965) in their new headquarters. Sure, it might be wasteful or tacky, but whatevs. Apparently I missed out on the fact that they took even more heat from the intertweets over the "presidential seal" rug featuring Octocat:

The controversy over the rug was over the use of the word "meritocracy", and today [Chris Wanstrath](https://twitter.com/defunkt) tweeted that they're getting rid of it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet center" lang="en"><p>We thought ‘meritocracy’ was a neat way to think of open source but now see the problems with it. Words matter.

It's good that they see the problems with meritocracy, as it is used. But I think the divergence between the denotative and connotative meanings of the word are worth exploring.

### What Is Meritocracy?

The term actually derives from a work of sociopolitical satire, ["The Rise of The Meritocracy"](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/792606.The_Rise_of_the_Meritocracy), by Michael Young. In that work, merit is assumed to be the combination of IQ and effort.

This is already problematic from the standpoint of even American views of equality, for as a society we claim to stand by the principle of "equality of opportunity", if not "equality of outcome". Granted, even this is a social fiction, but let's put that in parentheses for the moment.

Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that a society would benefit from having its best and brightest in control of the development of that society, and reap the rewards of contributing to the social good.

The first conclusion is that "meritocracy" is a redundant term, as what we are describing is rule by the "best", or "άριστοι" and we may as well resort to the previous term for this: "aristocracy".

And in fact, a true meritocracy (or even, if we follow the Greek, aristocracy) would likely be an idyllic system of social organization. But like its aristocratic predecessor, meritocracy suffers a fatal flaw, based in one of Aristotle's classical informal fallacies.

### Meritocracy, Aristocracy, _Petitio Principii_

Meritocracy, as the term is banddied about today, much like aristocracy in the past, [begs the question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question). That is, it assumes its conclusion as a premise. Surely, those in positions of power and wealth _must_ be the "best", the most meritorious, the άριστοι, since we live in a meritoocracy.

This is fallacious bullshit.

It is fallacious, because it is a clear aexample of a logical fallacy explicitly known to us for mellenia. It is bullshit, because it is observably false.

Now, I almost want to defend the GitHub rug because

1. It is adorable.
2. Meritocracy is not, in and of itself, a terrible concept.

But I have to side with the many critics of the rug because the symbolic overdetermination of "meritocracy" in contemporary American culture makes the term unsustainable. Like Levinas' conception of The Other, "it cannot contain what it seems to contain."

Like tweed, meritocracy seems to hide a multitude of sins, many of which should not be hidden. Meritocracy is the new Social Darwinism, another tragic example of _petitio principii_ which was rejected as bullshit even by its namesake.

### Words

I has a sad every time an etymologically valid word becomes overladen with unintended consequences because people are stupid, vainglorious, and thoughtless. Even if the word "meritocracy" originated in satire, it could have expressed something positive. But in the current climate... no.

The virtue of the idea of meritocracy is that we aren't _really_ all created equal... which is why theories like John Rawls' concept of [justice as fairness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_as_Fairness) are interesting/useful; we should be treated as equal regarding a relationship to the structure of society, but statistically, our abilities follow either a Gaussian or Paretian distribution, depending on context.

But that needs to be okay.
