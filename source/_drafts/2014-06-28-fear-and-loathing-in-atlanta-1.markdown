### Hotlanta

As soon as we walked out of the airport the heat overcame us. I think the usual
metaphor is "walking into a blast furnace" but at least a blast furnace is a dry
heat. This was like crawling up Satan's asshole on a bad hemorrhoid day.

At least Headquarters insisted that we fly down this time, after the situation
with the rental car in Las Vegas. I blamed the bats, but they just got real
quiet on the phone when I went into detail. There was also the lawsuit from that
hitchhiker we picked up, but my attorney assured me it had been "dealt with."

I don't ask too many questions when he says things in that real quiet voice.

I wasn't sure why they wanted me to cover the 2014 conference of the International
Society for Technology in Education. But I guess it's no stranger than a
presidential election.

We caught a cab to the hotel. A massive edifice with an interior like some
nightmarish H.R. Giger alien spinal column. Also eerily empty. Headquarters
insisted we arrive a day early, so the psychotic herds of glassy-eyed teachers
had yet to fill the cavernous space.

We stopped by the front desk to pick up the package I had shipped down in
advance of our arrival, and dropped off our luggage.

Quickly I took the package and my briefcase to the restroom for a quick inventory
and assessment. I opened the package and verified its contents:

1. Mescaline. A lot of it.
2. One bottle of ether
3. About 1.5 grams of cocaine
4. Almost a gram of heroin
5. A .38 calibre snub-nose revolver
6. More ether
7. About 50 mL of liquid LSD

Thank God for the United States Postal Service. It's damn near impossible to get
a reasonable amount of drugs and weapons on a plane anymore. The package seemed
a little light but I couldn't be sure. I figured it would be enough for at least
the beginning of the conference.

My attorney advised me that it would be prudent to take some mescaline before I
had to go cover the first of the pre-conference sessions, something entitled
"Hack Education." I was all for that, if my education was anything to go on it
was about time someone took an axe to the damn thing.

We packed the supplies into my briefcase and headed out for drinks.

### Out of the frying pan, into the fire

The hotel bar was a sad, empty place with a few lonely souls drinking at small
tables, so we decided to see what was available nearby. Out into the street, and
back into Satan's irritated tailpipe. We hit the first bar we saw, I don't even
remember the name, the heat was so mind-numbing. Greeted by a blast of cool air,
we ordered the largest tumblers of whiskey allowed by law, and stumbled back out
into the Georgia heat.

By the time we made it back to the hotel, my attorney looked like he had just
won last place in a wet Hawaiian shirt contest. My Panama hat was limp and the
humidity had extinguished my cigarette on its own. This was no way to live.

Suddenly I understood slavery in a new historical context. If you lived in this heat, the
moral compromise of owning another human being pales in comparison to having to
work in these conditions yourself. Suddenly, I understood Mitt Romney and Bain
Capital as well. Not that I approved, mind you, but I gained new insight. Here
I was at an education conference, and I was already learning.

That's when the drugs started to kick in.

We had intended to complete our conference registration at this point, but the
closer we got to the booth the clearer it became that it was staffed by eight
foot tall humanoid reptilians.

"Are you seeing this?" I asked my attorney. "It's happening again."

"Fuck this. We'll get our badges tomorrow," he replied.

A lesser man might become paranoid, having a second encounter with these
monstrosities.

The reptilians beckoned for us to come forward and claim our badges. Fuck that.
I wasn't about to go near those damn things again. We backed away slowly and
worked our way toward the "Hack Education" event.

The participants seemed, well, _mostly_ human. Human enough. We _were_ talking
about teachers, after all. It made me a little uncomfortable that they talked
about forming "pods," but since this was just some silly bullshit jargon about
topical groups, I managed to calm my attorney, who had just watched
_Invasion of The Bodysnatchers_ on a loop during a twelve hour acid trip.

We ended up joining the "pod" discussing "data."

### Ignorance is... ignorance

As I sat there, I fondly remembered my conversation with Richard M. Nixon about
professional football. Now here was a man who knew whereof he spoke. Not that it
qualified him to become the next leader of the free world, but damn, could Dick
talk football.

Now here I was, listening to a bunch of teachers &mdash; the people to whom we
entrust the future of the free world &mdash; talk about their concerns about
"data" and "privacy," neither of which concept they had the least frame of
reference to understand. One of them expressed her concern about Google harvesting
test scores and grade information.

Congratulations, you are completely ignorant of the prevailing law governing
your own so-called "profession."

Another thought there should be some governing body "policing" the collection of
data in education... once again, congratulations on your ignorance.

I hoped it was just the drugs but my attorney assured me that the little bit of
mescaline we had taken had already worn off and that yes, these paragons
responsible for educating the next generation were just that fucking ignorant
or stupid or both.
