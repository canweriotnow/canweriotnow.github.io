Ever since I was a little kid, precisely one artist and one director have managed to terrify
me: [H.R. Giger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._Giger) and [David Cronenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cronenberg).

Okay, wait. I grew up on classic Doctor Who, and had plenty of hiding [behind the sofa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_the_sofa)
moments when the Daleks came on screen. But it wasn't until one specific serial that I found the Daleks so terrifying, and it's related.

Go ahead, past the jump... I won't mention anything about the dead in hte new season of *Who.*

__SPOILER ALERT__

<!--more-->

In the Sixth Doctor serial, [*Revelation of The Daleks*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation_of_the_Daleks), it's
duh-duh-duh *revealed* that the Daleks are using a mortuary to harvest human tissue to breed a new generation of Daleks,
as the Kaled race has died with the planet Skaro. This notion is referenced, BTW, in the first season on the 2005
Doctor Who reboot, in which it is revealed that the Daleks are using the lethal reality TV shows as a source of fresh
genetic stock. But that's an aside.

There are other instances where I can recall this fear, but they're what we would now call mash-ups: for instance, the Borg
on Star Trek: TNG, which were aesthetically derivative of Giger and conceptually derivative of *Doctor Who's* Cybermen.

Yeah, the Cybermen got extra bio-creepy during that period as well.

What happened?

### The Desert of The Real

Well, shit, I just invoked _The Matrix_ and Slavoj Žižek in one subheading, didn't I. I must really be avoiding my topic.

Not that I wouldn't love to wax poetic on _The Matrix_ and tie Žižekian theories into damn near anything.

But this is about fear.

My fear.

My terror.

My horror of the organic.

### The Stuff of Nightmares

I began this post upon waking from a nightmare. One that fades as I write, but one that unifies the fears of becoming a dalek, a cyberman,
a borg, a zombie, a human host to some biotech that holds designs beyond my own.

It's funny, in a whistling past the graveyard sort of way. I've written about privacy, surveillance, I don't know how many real and
present dangers to humanity in the 21st century.

But this is what I fear.

I even find the idea of Skynet comforting in a a way; just robots wearing human skin, programmed to eliminate humanity. It's
almost a mercy.

This post is a confession of my deepest terrors, and it's painfully hard to put into words.

### The Irony

My Singularitarianism, my posthumanism... it's really about the union of the human and the machine, right? The abolition
of the divide between the two? And yet...

The _Doctor Who_ season cleser reinvoked all my childhood fears,
