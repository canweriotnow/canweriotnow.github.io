Hi. I'm Jason. I'm a hacker. Pleased to meet you.

I particularly love Ruby, Clojure, and most Lisp dialects you could name (particularly LISP-1 dialects; Common Lisp is a bit off the reservation for my tastes). I'm a polyglot programmer, and if there's a language out there I haven't tried, it's on the list; if I've tried it, I either use it as much as possible, or find it distasteful for a number of reasons.

I currently work at [Johns Hopkins Universtiy](http://www.jhu.edu), attached to the [Office of ID Card Services](http://www.idcs.jhu.edu). For me, that has little to do with ID cards and much more to do with developing systems (from web applications in Ruby on Rails, to services in Clojure) that abstract away the limitations of our wide array of proprietary systems that would handle the business needs of the operation if they weren't... well, I can't think of an adjective that isn't impolitic, so I'll leave it at that.

I love to code. When you get into that state where it's just you and the language and the bits, that's the best feeling on earth. 

I also have a wonderful wife, Candice, and a baby girl, Emma, who are the only thigs in the world better than software. So that's me.

If you would like to know more, you can visit [my about.me page](http://about.me/jason.lewis), and if you think you want to hire me, drop me [an email](mailto:jason@decomplecting.org).
