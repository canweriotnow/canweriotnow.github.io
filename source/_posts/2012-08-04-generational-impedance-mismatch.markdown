One thing I've come to observe working in higher ed is that you can run into a lot of issues with what I want to term "generational impedance mismatch." It's what happens when your ostensible customers are about 40 years older than your target demographic.

When I started on an internal administrative application about two years ago, I threw in some error pages with lolcats on them because... well, error pages are boring. Those got yankes because the customer thought they were "unprofessional." Okay, sure. It's an administrative app, so maybe this isn't the best thing to throw up after a catastrophic failure:

But the new crop of apps I'm writing don't target middle-aged administrators; they target students. Specifically, in addition to doing mundane things like reporting your a lost ID card or checking balances, there's a whole social gaming component. So far, I've been pretty successful at keeping things amusing (between the student focus group we assembled and the [JHU subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/jhu), my sense of humor is quickly vindicated), but the text is... kinda stodgy. 

I was discussing this with a co-worker, and we hit on what I think is a brilliant way of balancing stakeholder needs that are in conflict. The customer wants rather formal, business-like text that drily describes various functions of the application. On the other hand, students are going to be bored. But we know how to deal with target demographics who speak different languages, don't we? Localization to the rescue!
