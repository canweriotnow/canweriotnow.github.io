I recently authored a post suggesting that Google was [using Ingress to solve NP-hard problems](http://decomplecting.org/blog/2013/01/22/ingress-crowdsourcing-solutions-to-np-hard-problems/) that humans tend to be good at. It was a speculative piece, but tonight I came across an article entitled ["People and computers need each other"](http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sankar-human-computer-cooperation/index.html) that spoke to one of my favorite pet ideas, and, in my opinion, lent credence to the thesis of my earlier post.
