When I conceived of this post, it was going to be about how damn awesome [Octopress](http://octopress.org) is. And it certainly is awesome; it powers this blog, and makes writing it a joy, whereas trying to use [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com), [Blogger](http://blogger.com), or even newer alternatives like [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) or [Posterous](http://postero.us) were downright painful. But what I'm more interested in is the growing trend among apps, services, and even operating systems that has made projects like Octopress necessary.
