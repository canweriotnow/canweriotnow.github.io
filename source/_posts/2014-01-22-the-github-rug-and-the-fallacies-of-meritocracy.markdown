[GitHub](https://github.com) took some heat from the likes of [Valleywag](http://valleywag.gawker.com) for building a [replica of the oval office](http://valleywag.gawker.com/how-not-to-spend-your-startups-money-a-replica-of-the-1265655965) in their new headquarters. Sure, it might be wasteful or tacky, but whatevs. Apparently I missed out on the fact that they took even more heat from the intertweets over the "presidential seal" rug featuring Octocat:

The controversy over the rug was over the use of the word "meritocracy", and today [Chris Wanstrath](https://twitter.com/defunkt) tweeted that they're getting rid of it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>We thought ‘meritocracy’ was a neat way to think of open source but now see the problems with it. Words matter.

It's good that they see the problems with meritocracy, as it is used. But I think the divergence between the denotative and connotative meanings of the word are worth exploring.

### What Is Meritocracy?

The term actually derives from a work of sociopolitical satire, ["The Rise of The Meritocracy"](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/792606.The_Rise_of_the_Meritocracy), by Michael Young. In that work, merit is assumed to be the combination of IQ and effort.

This is already problematic from the standpoint of even American views of equality, for as a society we claim to stand by the principle of "equality of opportunity", if not "equality of outcome". Granted, even this is a social fiction, but let's put that in parentheses for the moment.

Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that a society would benefit from having its best and brightest in control of the development of that society, and reap the rewards of contributing to the social good.

The first conclusion is that "meritocracy" is a redundant term, as what we are describing is rule by the "best", or "άριστοι" and we may as well resort to the previous term for this: "aristocracy".

And in fact, a true meritocracy (or even, if we follow the Greek, aristocracy) would likely be an idyllic system of social organization. But like its aristocratic predecessor, meritocracy suffers a fatal flaw, based in one of Aristotle's classical informal fallacies.

### Meritocracy, Aristocracy, _Petitio Principii_

Meritocracy, as the term is banddied about today, much like aristocracy in the past, begs the question.
