Last night, I encountered some [trollbait](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TROLL%20BAIT) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com), and I bit. I generally try really, really hard not to troll on Twitter, but sometimes the draw of the bait overcomes the will.

It eventually dawned on me that the juiciest trollbait isn't someone who is stupid, na√Øve, or overly sensitive (although, those are definite contributors), but someone who is unfamiliar with internet culture.

## The Incident

Okay, so it started like this. I saw a tweet from someone I don't follow. I didn't even _disagree_ with it (I actually agree completely), but the phrasing allowed for some logical conclusions that potentially bordered on the absurd.

Now, most people (I think) would either laugh or roll their eyes, and that would be the end of it. [@TouchstoneZ](https://twitter.com/#!/TouchstoneZ), sadly, did not choose either of these paths.

At this point, I was just trying to explain what I had found amusing. I should know better than to ever explain a joke. If you have to explain it, it's never going to be funny, right? 

I was just going to leave well enough alone. Until my joke about bathing children got compared to rape jokes.

See, those of us who are (culturally) from the internet have this sense. Maybe it's like a Spidey sense, maybe it's a Jacobson's organ for detecting [butthurt](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/butthurt), but when your sense of proportion is that out of whack (bath jokes == rape jokes), latent trolls smell blood in the water. It's like pissing off Bruce Banner. 

So I started trolling.

Of course, the thing about trolling is it is *wayyy* too easy to take it too far... like when someone accuses you of making rape jokes (or the equivalent thereof), when you're *not* making rape jokes... who can fault you for going straight to an [Insanity Wolf](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/insanity-wolf) macro?

{% img float-right /images/post-img/too-far-twitter.png %}

I'll note here: yes, it was, as mentioned in the thread, "disgusting and inappropriate in every way." It's an Insanity Wolf image macro. They're *all* "disgusting and inappropriate in every way." That's the point. 

Was it taking things too far? You betcha.

That's what trolls do. I'm not defending trolling as a practice or pastime, by the way. Trolling is not very nice and should probably be avoided in most cases. But once you've started feeding a troll that sweet, sweet, outrage and butthurt, the troll's gonna latch onto whatever sensitive area you've exposed in hopes of another serving.

The only solution is to recognize when someone is trolling you... and ignoring them. If you're on Twitter, you can *block* people who are being jerks. I'd wager that in at least ninety percent of cases, an ignored troll will, within minutes, find something better (or at least more entertaining) to do. 

Of course, you could, instead, do the **worst possible thing.**

{% img center /images/post-img/worst-thing.png %}

NEVER DO THIS. Never, ever, **ever** address someone who is *admittedly* trolling you as if they were serious.

At this point, I had to try and restore *some* sanity to the proceedings.

Only one possible reaction at this point, of course.

## Internet Culture

The thing was, my interlocutors on Twitter were from an alien culture. By which I mean, "not from the internet." In another situation, one might have referred to them as n00bs. The terminology doesn't seem super appropriate to Twitter, but the interesting thing about Twitter is that it is (for many) the first foray beyond the walled garden of Facebook or the personal fiefdom of blogging. First contact with the open internet. First contact with an alien culture.

It's increasingly clear to anyone who pays attention to such things that the internet has a culture all its own, independent of whatever national or ethnic or other cultural/subcultural groups supply its constituents. 

Part of this is what was addressed in the mid-1990's under the rubric of "netiquette." You don't TYPE IN ALL CAPS, you don't forward email chain letters, etc. 

What we now group under "Internet Culture" began long, long ago, in the Elder Time, on USENET. In places like comp.os.linux and alt.non.sequitur and alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork, a culture grew, much like a petri dish of some noxious bacterium. Later this culture evolved the likes of [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/), [4chan](http://4chan.org/), and [reddit](http://reddit.com/).

### The Art of Trolling

One phenomenon of the explosion of web apps like Twitter is the ensuing culture clash. Whereas on Facebook you can closely control your interactions, and on Pinterest you're probably interacting with hipster girls and soccer moms (slap me for that stereotype if you like), Twitter is a big, diverse cocktail party. Eventually, internet natives are going to interact with tourists.

So I'd like to provide some advice for the tourists.

Trolling, at its best, is like the internet culture's equivalent of [playing the dozens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dozens). No real harm is meant; we're just looking for [lulz](http://ohinternet.com/Lulz). The exchange I detailed above didn't *start* as deliberate trolling; it started as a joke based on deliberate mis-generalization of a statement. Once butthurt ensued from a well-intentioned jest, however... well, troll speed ahead.

In 2008, the New York Times ran an article entitled ["The Trolls Among Us"](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?_r=2&pagewanted=1). It was a detailed piece on internet trolling, following the posthumous trolling of Mitchell Henderson, who was, indeed, "an hero." (cf. article if you're not familiar). 

The most telling exchange is between the journalist, Matthias Schwartz, and one of his interviewees, Jason Fortuny.

If you want to stop being trolled, stop reacting, stop being offended, and just...

### N00b School

Here are a few tips for surviving your initial encounter with the dominant culture of the internet:

#### Trolling

1. You WILL be trolled. You cannot control or prevent this.
2. You CAN control your reaction.
3. The best reaction is no reaction.
4. Do not feed the trolls.

#### Memes

1. Just because you think lolcats are cute, does not mean you understand the wider culture that produces most of the internet memes.
2. You can't have lolcats without insanity wolf.
3. Memes (or their instances as image macros) will contain jokes about cats, computers, and puppies. Also, rape, murder, and the Holocaust.
4. Ignore the ones you don't like; concentrate on the positive. Make more lolcats. Getting butthurt about Foul Bachelor Frog isn't going to do anyone any good.

#### Rules of the Internet.

You'd probably be better off assuming everything on this list is true.

### Post-Colonial Internet Studies

If I seem a bit harsh in my appraisal of internet culture (and/or the induction of new members into the social fabric of teh intertubes), it's not necessarily deliberate. 

However, I do feel it is necessary to belabor the point that *internet culture is a real culture.* 

Perhaps I can illustrate via a metaphor. If you were to travel to Iran (for instance), and behave precisely as you do in your everyday American life, without regard for local custom or Sharia law, the *best* possible outcome you could *hope* for is some mild butthurt. More likely, you would be jailed, executed, and/or deported (possibly all three).

On the internet, failing to appreciate that you're dealing with a very real foreign culture will get you trolled, cause you extreme butthurt, and *maybe,* in a worst case scenario, get you doxed, publicly humiliated, et cetera. 

Maybe "the lulz" isn't the best motivation. A lot of bad things happen "for the lulz." But it's unrealistic to expect a culture to change just because you're a delicate flower. You really have to adapt or GTFO.

As more "normal" people enter the fray, I'm sure "internet culture" will be diluted, or at least chased into the labyrinthine warrens of /r/wtf and /b/, and so on.

But here's the question. Do you want to be an immigrant, or a colonist? Do you want to force your worldview on this incredible and bizarre society that is unlike anything hitherto existing in world history? Or do you want to bring your own unique perspective, experience, etc. to the table, and help our culture to be all that it can be?

The price of the former is for you to stamp out trolling, pass ACTA, SOPA, etc., revivify the CDA and the DMCA, and destroy what we've all helped to build over decades. 

The price of the latter is to ignore the trolls, thicken your skin, learn about the cultural history of the internet. We've done some cool stuff here, whether that "we" in a given instance is /b/ or the IETF. 

I've presented this as a choice, which is a bit disingenuous. The truth is, you **will** be assimilated.
